And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface\nof the waters. \n\nHarris, W. H., III, Ritzema, E., Brannan, R., Mangum, D., Dunham, J., Reimer,\nJ. A., &amp; Wierenga, M., eds. (2012). The Lexham English Bible (Ge 1:2). Lexham\nPress. \n\n</code></pre>\n<p>תֹּ֫הוּ | to-hu | formless בֹּ֫הוּ | ba-hu | empty, void</p>\n<p>The first image is that there is &quot;unordered wild and waste (wasteland)&quot; (we\ntypically see this as formless and void). There is also &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;,\nwhich is a dark chaotic ocean - and this is the ANE person's conception of\n&quot;nothing&quot;. Westerners think &quot;nothing&quot; means &quot;no atmoic particles, no matter&quot;\nbut the ANE person would've thought about creation as unordered chaos.</p>\n<p>God's spirit is hovering over the dark, formless, wild, chaotic ocean.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#day-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"day-1\"></a>Day 1</h3>\n<pre><code>\n“Let there be light!” And there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it\nwas good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between\nthe darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.\nAnd there was evening and there was morning, the first day.  \n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Creation starts by separating light from darkness. The darkness is now tamed,\nit is apart of an ordered cycle. The ordering of the days is now established\nand is repeated in every subsequent day of creation</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#day-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"day-2\"></a>Day 2</h3>\n<pre><code>\n“Let there be a vaulted dome in the midst of the waters, and let it cause a\nseparation between the waters.” 7 So God made the vaulted dome, and he caused a\nseparation between the waters which were under the vaulted dome and between the\nwaters which were over the vaulted dome. And it was so. 8 And God called the\nvaulted dome “heaven.” \n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then on day 2 he separates &quot;waters from the waters&quot;. God &quot;splits&quot; (Exodus) the\nwaters, brining order to the chaotic waters.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#day-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"day-3\"></a>Day 3</h3>\n<pre><code>\n“Let the waters under heaven be gathered to one place, and let the dry\nground appear.”\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The waters below are gathered together - so there is further order being\nbrought to the waters.</p>\n<pre><code>\n“Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing\nfruit ⌊in which there is seed⌋—according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was\nso. 12 And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its\nkind, and trees bearing fruit ⌊in which there was seed⌋ according to its kind.\n\n</code></pre>\n<h4><a href=\"#bonus\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"bonus\"></a>Bonus</h4>\n<p>Fruit trees (foreshadowing) are then brought up from the lands</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notice that there are things even in the first 3 days that will be apart of\nthe narrative going forward</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>So in the first 3 days God has handled the unordered wild and waste</p>\n<p>What this cosmos needs now is inhabitants</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><a href=\"#day-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"day-4\"></a>Day 4</h3>\n<pre><code>\n“Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven ⌊to separate day from\nnight⌋, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and\nyears, \n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &quot;lights&quot; are clearly the sun, moon, and stars. But they are not called by\nthose names, they are just called &quot;lights&quot;. Which is the descriptive word מָאוֹר\n| ma-or, used to describe the light from the lamp stands in the temple, which\nwas also a symbol of God's presence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notice this is <u>not</u> the same word for &quot;light&quot; in the separation of light\nand darkness, that is אוֹר | or, not ma-or</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>\nPsalm 90:8 (LEB): 8 You have put our iniquities before you,  our hidden\nsins into the light (מָאוֹר | ma-or) of your countenance.  \n\nHarris, W.
