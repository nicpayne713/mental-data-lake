      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video.\nThe app is great (ðŸ’¯ would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are\nunobtrusive.</p>\n<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Do\">that you judge, you will be judged.\n\nAnd with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you. ```\n\nThere are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an\nAuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost\ncertainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of\nScripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying\nhe'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew\n7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - `do unto\nothers as you would have them do unto you` is how my Souther Baptist Grandma\nused to say it.\n\nI've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live\nBiblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at\nnon-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally\nwhat I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty\nunreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double\nstandards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do\nyou take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own\neye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely\ndon't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get\nolder or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a\nposition of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my\nfamily is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people\nliving their lives.\n\nThe BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is\ndirectionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a\nkid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly\ndriven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt\nresponsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of\nGod's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my\ntime thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will\nsave who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage\n- my own life and family.\n\n&lt;!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer --&gt;\n\n[github]: https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite\n</code></pre>\n",
