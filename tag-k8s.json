An easy way to push things through is to\nopen k9s, view the Deployments, and edit the env vars there so the pods can be\nin the right state to restart and pickup the changes (you've obviously fixed\nthe values file already right?)</p>\n<p>Well the Notification Controller was the pod hanging, and I couldn't find it in\nthe Deployments view! This blew my mind... until I realized that it was a\nStateful Set.</p>\n<p>So, this is not a comparison of the 2 - this is just a note to say that all I\nhad to do was find the StatefulSets in k9s and do the same workflow for editing\nwhat I needed to edit to get the pods into workable state while working on the\nvalues file...</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
