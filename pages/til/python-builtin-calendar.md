## Being lazy

I almost exclusively use Python for my job and have been eye-balls deep in it for almost 5 years but I really lack in-depth knowledge of builtins.
I recently learned of an awesome builtin called `calendar`  that has way more than I know about for sure but I'm glad I know it's here now!

I only needed it because I was too lazy to hard code the 7 weekdays into my module but it turns out there's a lot of useful things like `calendar.isleap()`!

## Future use

I'm not exactly sure what will come my way where `calendar` will be super relevant but like anything, I'm just glad to know it exists for when the time arises!
