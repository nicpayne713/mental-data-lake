The book of James is the legacy of this Jacob's wisdom which was heavily influenced by two things:

1. Sermon on the Mount / Matthew 5-7
2. Proverbs - expecially chapters 1-9

### Summary

_perfect_: Hebrew: Tamim, Greek: Teleios

## Jan 21

!!! scripture "James 1:1"

    James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.

Dispersion: διασπορά - same word used by Peter to describe Jesus-followers as exiles

!!! scripture "James 1:2-11"

    2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
    3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And
    let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and
    complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
    God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
    him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
    is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that
    person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he
    is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother
    boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a
    flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its
    scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty
    perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
