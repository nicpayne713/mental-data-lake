The book of James is the legacy of this Jacob's wisdom which was heavily influenced by two things:

1. Sermon on the Mount / Matthew 5-7
2. Proverbs - expecially chapters 1-9

### Summary

These are short challenging wisdom speeches full of metaphors and one-liners... Live in a wise way, submitting to Jesus

We are all fractrued and inconsistent people

_perfect_: Hebrew: Tamim, Greek: Teleios

12-18: God is generous and gives us new birth through Jesus

19-27: Don't just listen to God's word but _do_ it. It's the Torah of Freedom

!!! scripture "James 1:1"

    James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.

Dispersion: διασπορά - same word used by Peter to describe Jesus-followers as exiles

!!! scripture "James 1:2-11"

    2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
    3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And
    let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and
    complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
    God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
    him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
    is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that
    person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he
    is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother
    boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a
    flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its
    scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty
    perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.

## July 15

> Missed several meetings due to unfortunate travel circumstances

!!! scripture "James 3:13-18"

    13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him
    show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy
    and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
    15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,
    unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there
    will be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first
    pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,
    impartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by
    those who make peace.

## December 16

!!! scripture "James 5:13-20"

    13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone
    cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
    summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing
    him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will
    save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has
    committed sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one
    another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective
    prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being
    with the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,
    and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he
    prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.
    19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and
    someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner
    back from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and
    will cover over a great number of sins.
