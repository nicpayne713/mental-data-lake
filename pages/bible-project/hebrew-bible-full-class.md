# 01 The Shape of the Hebrew Bible

## Session 1: What on Earth is the Hebrew Bible?

This class is not so much a survey of the HB, it is Tim's attempt to distil the
most helpful things for understanding it in a consumable way for laypeople.

A chunk of this is the other people giving some of their own background. One
lady said something that might be helpful for ministry - "Maybe that thing that
I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'"

!!! note "how to love"
    
    Maybe that thing that I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'

    1. Hero-example model
        * Stories get isolated and distilled down into a simple moral model, where the hero is just the hero. 
        * Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense
        * There's something correct about this - but the oversimplification usually comes out of a massive re-writting of the stories, then anyone raised on those versions of the story is scaldalized when they read it for real

    2. Poltical-authority source
        * Political parties hijacking "The Bible says X about Y" as a means to harvest authority from a book that many people claim is authoritative.

    3. Theology answer book model
        * Treating the Bible like a dictionary of key/value pairs where keys are questions and values are simple answers.
        * This ignores narrative, and general literacy.
        * The instinct may be right - the Bible should profoundly shape my view of everything, but it isn't simple

    4. Inspirational-heart-warming model
        * Verse-a-day calendars
        * Jermiah 29:11

!!! warning ""

    Are we imposing a set of questions that are foreign to what the authors are
    trying to communicate? do we need to set our cultural agendas aside to just
    listen?

A result of asking the wrong questions is the common story of people's faith being dismantled _by reading the Bible_

!!! note "DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible"

    One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
    Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
    Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
    served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
    scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
    kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
    ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
    side the New Testament? â€”
