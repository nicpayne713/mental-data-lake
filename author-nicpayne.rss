<p>Social media has become a cornerstone of modern communication, allowing individuals to connect across borders and share ideas instantly. However, traditional platforms have raised concerns about censorship, data privacy, and the monopolistic control of user-generated content. <strong>Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays)</strong>, a decentralized social media protocol, offers a revolutionary alternative by emphasizing freedom, privacy, and user autonomy. This essay explores the transformative power of Nostr, why it matters, and provides a practical guide for beginners to get started.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters"></a>The Power of Decentralization: Why Nostr Matters</h3>
<p>At its core, Nostr is a decentralized protocol designed to enable social media functionality without reliance on centralized servers. Unlike traditional platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, which depend on centralized infrastructure owned by corporations, Nostr operates on a peer-to-peer network facilitated by relays. This structural shift offers several key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong><br />
Centralized platforms often act as gatekeepers of content, enforcing moderation policies that can result in censorship. Nostr, on the other hand, allows users to communicate directly without interference from centralized authorities. This makes it particularly valuable for individuals in regions with restrictive speech laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong><br />
On traditional platforms, users sacrifice ownership of their data, which is often monetized by corporations. Nostr empowers users to retain control over their content and personal information by using cryptographic keys to manage identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience Against Shutdowns</strong><br />
Centralized platforms are vulnerable to outages, government intervention, or corporate decisions to deplatform users. Nostr’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity can shut it down, providing a more resilient communication medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open and Transparent Ecosystem</strong><br />
As an open protocol, Nostr allows developers to create interoperable applications and services. This fosters innovation, enabling users to choose from a variety of client applications while maintaining access to the same network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone"></a>How Nostr Works: The Technical Backbone</h3>
<p>Nostr uses a simple yet effective system to transmit messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public and Private Keys</strong>: Each user generates a pair of cryptographic keys. The private key acts as their identity, while the public key serves as their address on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Relays</strong>: These are lightweight servers that broadcast messages. Users send notes (messages) to relays, which distribute them to other users.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong>: Users access Nostr through client applications, which function as user interfaces. Examples include Damus (for mobile) and Amethyst.</li>
</ul>
<p>This decentralized architecture eliminates single points of failure and gives users the flexibility to connect via multiple clients.</p>

<h3><a href="#a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr"></a>A Beginner’s Guide to Getting Started with Nostr</h3>
<p>For those new to Nostr, the decentralized structure might seem intimidating at first. However, with the following step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to join the network and start interacting with others seamlessly.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-1-generate-your-keys" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-1-generate-your-keys"></a>Step 1: Generate Your Keys</h4>
<p>The first step is to create a pair of cryptographic keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: This is your unique identifier and must be kept secret. Treat it like a password.</li>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: This is your &quot;address&quot; on Nostr and can be shared with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Nostr client applications automatically generate these keys for you upon sign-up. Ensure you securely back up your private key, as losing it means losing access to your account permanently.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-2-choose-a-nostr-client" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-2-choose-a-nostr-client"></a>Step 2: Choose a Nostr Client</h4>
<p>Clients are the gateways through which you interact with the Nostr protocol. Popular options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damus</strong> (iOS/Android): User-friendly and feature-rich.</li>
<li><strong>Amethyst</strong> (Android): Tailored for Android users with a sleek interface.</li>
<li><strong>Web Clients</strong>: Platforms like <strong>Nostr.guru</strong> or <strong>Iris</strong> allow you to access Nostr via a browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Install your chosen client and log in using your keys.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-3-connect-to-relays" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-3-connect-to-relays"></a>Step 3: Connect to Relays</h4>
<p>Relays are the backbone of the Nostr network, enabling message distribution. Most clients come pre-configured with default relays, but you can add more for better connectivity and reliability. Simply search for &quot;Nostr relay services&quot; and paste the relay URLs into your client settings.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-4-explore-and-interact" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-4-explore-and-interact"></a>Step 4: Explore and Interact</h4>
<p>Once set up, you can start exploring the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow Users</strong>: Add public keys of other users to your feed.</li>
<li><strong>Post Notes</strong>: Share your thoughts or updates by creating a note, similar to a tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong>: Interact with others by replying to or liking their notes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="#step-5-customize-your-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-5-customize-your-experience"></a>Step 5: Customize Your Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Relays Carefully</strong>: Some relays may specialize in certain topics or enforce content moderation policies. Tailor your relay list based on your interests and values.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Your Keys</strong>: Use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets or encrypted cloud storage to protect your private key.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Clients</strong>: Try multiple clients to find the one that suits your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emergence of platforms like Nostr signals a broader shift toward decentralization in the digital era. By prioritizing user autonomy and privacy, Nostr challenges the centralized paradigms that have dominated the social media landscape for years. Its open architecture invites developers, activists, and everyday users to co-create a more inclusive and censorship-resistant digital space.</p>
<p>Moreover, Nostr's impact extends beyond social media. Its decentralized protocol can be adapted for various purposes, such as secure communication, decentralized marketplaces, or even collaborative work environments. This versatility makes it a foundational building block for the next generation of internet technologies.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Nostr represents a profound evolution in social media, offering a decentralized, user-centric alternative to traditional platforms. By empowering individuals with control over their identity, data, and content, it paves the way for a freer and more resilient online ecosystem. While its decentralized nature may pose a learning curve for beginners, the benefits far outweigh the challenges. By embracing Nostr, we can collectively take a step toward a more open and equitable digital future.</p>
<p>For those ready to explore this transformative platform, the journey begins with a simple act: generating your keys and connecting to the network. From there, the power of decentralized communication lies in your hands.</p>

<p>After generating a keypair on a nostr app (I started with primal) I copied my
public key to <code>/.well-known/nostr.json</code> and put that at the root of my site at
<code>https://pype.dev</code>.</p>
<p>The file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  “names”: {
    “nic”: “npub1q3fsec2vcv99v80ga72dlv90qwkqmuxqcr6mdyumcmpkgudlhrespyurfj”
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So now I can use <code>nic@pype.dev</code> as on nostr because the client will verify the
pubkey associated with my profile with my domain!</p>

<h2><a href="#genesis-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="genesis-1"></a>Genesis 1</h2>
<p>There is a cyclical pattern of Genesis 1-11.</p>
<p>Introduction 1:1 may be a summary heading rather than the first &quot;verse&quot;.</p>
<h3><a href="#chaos" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="chaos"></a>Chaos</h3>
<p>The narrative begins in 1:2, and the start of everything is a &quot;non-created
world&quot;, which in the ancient mind we should think about as &quot;non-ordered
reality&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>
Genesis 1:2 (LEB): 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was
over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface
of the waters.

Press. 

</code></pre>
<p>תֹּ֫הוּ | to-hu | formless בֹּ֫הוּ | ba-hu | empty, void</p>
<p>The first image is that there is &quot;unordered wild and waste (wasteland)&quot; (we
typically see this as formless and void). There is also &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;,
which is a dark chaotic ocean - and this is the ANE person's conception of
&quot;nothing&quot;. Westerners think &quot;nothing&quot; means &quot;no atmoic particles, no matter&quot;
but the ANE person would've thought about creation as unordered chaos.</p>
<p>God's spirit is hovering over the dark, formless, wild, chaotic ocean.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-1"></a>Day 1</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be light!” And there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it
was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between
the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.  

</code></pre>
<p>Creation starts by separating light from darkness. The darkness is now tamed,
it is apart of an ordered cycle. The ordering of the days is now established
and is repeated in every subsequent day of creation</p>
<h3><a href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-2"></a>Day 2</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be a vaulted dome in the midst of the waters, and let it cause a
separation between the waters.” 7 So God made the vaulted dome, and he caused a
separation between the waters which were under the vaulted dome and between the
waters which were over the vaulted dome. And it was so. 8 And God called the
vaulted dome “heaven.” 

</code></pre>
<p>Then on day 2 he separates &quot;waters from the waters&quot;. God &quot;splits&quot; (Exodus) the
waters, brining order to the chaotic waters.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-3"></a>Day 3</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let the waters under heaven be gathered to one place, and let the dry
ground appear.”

</code></pre>
<p>The waters below are gathered together - so there is further order being
brought to the waters.</p>
<pre><code>
“Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing
fruit ⌊in which there is seed⌋—according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was
so. 12 And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its
kind, and trees bearing fruit ⌊in which there was seed⌋ according to its kind.

</code></pre>
<h4><a href="#bonus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="bonus"></a>Bonus</h4>
<p>Fruit trees (foreshadowing) are then brought up from the lands</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that there are things even in the first 3 days that will be apart of
the narrative going forward</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>So in the first 3 days God has handled the unordered wild and waste</p>
<p>What this cosmos needs now is inhabitants</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-4"></a>Day 4</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven ⌊to separate day from
night⌋, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and
years, 

</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;lights&quot; are clearly the sun, moon, and stars. But they are not called by
those names, they are just called &quot;lights&quot;. Which is the descriptive word מָאוֹר
| ma-or, used to describe the light from the lamp stands in the temple, which
was also a symbol of God's presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice this is <u>not</u> the same word for &quot;light&quot; in the separation of light
and darkness, that is אוֹר | or, not ma-or</p>

Genesis 1:20–21 (LEB): 20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms

<p>I was debugging some ArgoCD stuff earlier today and I love using k9s to explore
my k8s resources.</p>
<p>The TLDR is that I put some bad env vars in the <code>global</code> values for my ArgoCD
pods, this caused the webUI to hang. An easy way to push things through is to
open k9s, view the Deployments, and edit the env vars there so the pods can be
in the right state to restart and pickup the changes (you've obviously fixed
the values file already right?)</p>
<p>Well the Notification Controller was the pod hanging, and I couldn't find it in
the Deployments view! This blew my mind... until I realized that it was a
Stateful Set.</p>
<p>So, this is not a comparison of the 2 - this is just a note to say that all I
had to do was find the StatefulSets in k9s and do the same workflow for editing
what I needed to edit to get the pods into workable state while working on the
values file...</p>

<p>docker contexts are great, would recommend putting them in your prompt though (via starship or something else)... here's why</p>
<p>I like to manage my containers remotely - I have a nice development setup on my desktop and I try to keep my server as bare-bones as possible. For a while I've been using ansible which makes it easy to manage configuration etc on other machines. But I recently learned about docker contexts and I'm planning to scale down my homelab management to just docker-compose stacks rather than a bunch of super complicated ansible playbooks</p>
<p>So, setting up a context is easy - it's basically an ssh connection to another machine!</p>
<p><code>docker context create koober --docker &quot;host=ssh://nic@koober&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>koober</code> is one of my dev machines and my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> is setup such that I can <code>ssh nic@koober</code>, this makes the context work really seamlessly.</p>
<p>So there's the <code>default</code> context (the machine you're on) and now I have <code>koober</code></p>
<p>To use it you run <code>docker context use koober</code></p>
<p>And then to check we can <code>ls</code> the contexts</p>
<pre><code>docker context ls
NAME       DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT               ERROR

koober *                                             ssh://nic@koober
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice the * - that indicates that's our current context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#trouble" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="trouble"></a>Trouble</h2>
<p>Now here's where things get hairy... you've gotta be super-aware of what context you're using. I have an indicator in my starship prompt that shows the current context, but since I'm new to using them I kind of didn't notice it until I ran into this issue...</p>
<p>I'm working on a python application in docker but was not able to execute the entrypoint even though I KNEW the file was there... let's take a look</p>
<h3><a href="#example" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="example"></a>Example</h3>

<p><code>koboer</code> is a remote context, the <code>docker run</code> and <code>docker compose up</code> commands are interacting with the docker socket on that machine.</p>
<p>So if I compose up the stack notice that there's a volume bind mount in there - well those do <em>not</em> work with contexts (or at least I'm not aware of hose to make it work) and so the <code>/app</code> directory was getting blown away essentially with an empty overlay...</p>
<p>But when running with just <code>docker run</code> with no volume mount, the code was copied in during the build and is right where we expect it...</p>

<p>I'm building a few FastAPI apps to throw in docker and run on my homelab... I wanted to add healthchecks and here's a simple way to do it</p>
<p>Make sure to install <code>curl</code> in the dockerfile (near the top for effeciency)</p>
<pre><code># Install curl with minimal dependencies
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean &amp;&amp; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

</code></pre>
<p>Then I recommend making compose files even for single image deployments</p>
<pre><code>services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: .
        target: /app
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/app
      - DOCKER_ENV=true
      - UV_VIRTUALENV=/opt/app-env
    user: &quot;1000:1000&quot;
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [&quot;CMD&quot;, &quot;curl&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:8000/health&quot;]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

</code></pre>
<p>Then finally you'll need a <code>/health</code> endpoint</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
@app.get(&quot;/health&quot;, response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def health_check():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A health check endpoint that returns a status message.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Service is healthy&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

<h1><a href="#the-flood-story-and-jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-flood-story-and-jesus"></a>The Flood Story and Jesus</h1>
<p>Jesus brings up the Flood story from Genesis just one time (in the recorded teachings we have).</p>
<p>First to set the scene, Jesus and his disciples are visiting the temple, and the disiples are kind of &quot;ooo-ing&quot; and &quot;aaah-ing&quot; when Jesus tells them about about the coming destruction...</p>
<pre><code>Matthew 24:1–2 (ESV):  24 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his
disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he
answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will
not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”  

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:1–2). (2016). Crossway Bibles.

</code></pre>
<pre><code>Matthew 24:37–39 (ESV): 37 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming
of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered
the ark, 39 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away,
so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:37–39). (2016). Crossway Bibles.
</code></pre>
<p>At one point in Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple in
Jerusalem, he brings up the Son of Man and Noah...</p>
<p>Jesus says that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; will be like when Noah built the
ark, and no one understood until the flood (κατακλυσμός | kataklysmos) came and
took them away.</p>
<p>In Jesus' mind the flood narrative gives him imagery and vocabulary to talk
about when God allows foreign powers to come and bring judgement... This isn't
an interpretation of the flood narrative, but it clues us into the idea that
the Hebrew bible is full of imagery, like a quilt, that follows a (or several)
pattern(s).</p>
<pre><code>Jesus understood the flood story as a pattern - a theological category to talk
about God overthrowing the corrupt power systems of our world - Tim Mackie
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I think sometimes we look at the flood and think God is so bad for taking out
all of humanity, but we miss the point... God is RESTORING humanity by
removing corruption... that's eventually the story we're invited into via
faith in Jesus</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="types"></a>Types</h2>
<p>A <code>type</code> is a category of prophecy, and an <code>antitype</code> is the revelation of the type.</p>
<p>Essentially - a <code>type</code> is a pattern, and the <code>antytype</code> is the revelation of
the meaning of the pattern - and without understanding the preceding types (in
this case, the flood) then the antitype cannot be understood (in this case
baptism)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a trivial example of how a type, or a pattern, can be noticed and even build
anticipation is to think 2, 4, 6, 8... what comes next? 10, and we all know
that immediately. Types in general, and types in the Bible are no different,
albeit not so simple...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#flood-and-baptism" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="flood-and-baptism"></a>Flood and Baptism</h2>
<p>Brace yourself...</p>
<pre><code>1 Peter 3:18–22 (ESV): 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous
for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which he went and proclaimed to the
spirits in prison, 20 because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience
waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few,
that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which
corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but
as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with
angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.  

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (1 Pe 3:18–22). (2016). Crossway
Bibles.
</code></pre>
<p>Notice verse 21 - &quot;Baptism, which <u>corresponds</u> to this&quot;</p>
<p>Corresponds is the word ἀντίτυπος (antitupos) in Greek, which means &quot;anti-type&quot;
This means clearly that the <code>type</code>, or <em>a</em> type, for baptism, is the flood
narrative... or that baptism is the antitype for the flood</p>
<p>What does this mean for baptism?</p>
<pre><code>21 Baptism, which
corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but
as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with
angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him
</code></pre>
<p>Through baptism, we experience with Jesus, resurrection and rule of the angels,
authorities, and power of the world...</p>
<h2><a href="#take-away" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="take-away"></a>Take Away</h2>
<p>For the disciples listening... are they arguing about when the flood happened?
or if it was a global or local flood?</p>
<p>No... they are listening to Jesus unpack patterns in the Bible and they hear
him invite them, through a story they know very well, into rule and reign with
him</p>

<h1><a href="#the-flood-story-in-the-hebrew-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-flood-story-in-the-hebrew-bible"></a>The Flood Story in the Hebrew Bible</h1>
<p>I'm slowly making my way through some Bible Project classes online because Tim
Mackie is a fantastic teacher and BP has done be a <em>great</em> service by opening
my eyes to the reality of the Biblical narrative and what it means for my life
of faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>The second session is filled with great points and 10 minutes in I had to jot
this one down...</p>
<h2><a href="#a-quilt-as-history" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="a-quilt-as-history"></a>A Quilt as History</h2>
<p>Imagine your grandmother's grandmother made a quilt, and passed it down the
family tree. In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date you
but would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning
that was never intended to be present.</p>
<p>The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that
might've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else
someone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they
are telling with their quilt.</p>
<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they
come from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what
those pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The
creator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be
&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an
article of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the
author (your grandma) <u>repurposed</u> it for that very reason, to change the
meaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different
than what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.</p>
<h2><a href="#creation-as-a-quilt" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="creation-as-a-quilt"></a>Creation as a Quilt</h2>
<p>The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor
home very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew
scripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their
time and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to
communicate the story of the <em>actual</em> God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>
<p>For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the
spirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than
a short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not
only that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where
their savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her
eventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have
to fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension
with creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters
that other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of
the waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the
stories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;, but at the very least made them
relevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and
Lord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner
with him (as his image-bearers).</p>
<h2><a href="#calm-down" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="calm-down"></a>Calm Down</h2>
<p>A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get
brought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English
translation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the
Word of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for
himself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they
know.</p>
<p>It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of
what's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's
parallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly
communicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks
order into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation
narratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>
<p>That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,
carried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and
narratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his
love for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>

<h2><a href="#explanation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="explanation"></a>Explanation</h2>
<p>-aHAX: Preserves attributes (archive mode, hard links, ACLs, extended attributes).
--chmod=Da+s: Ensures the setgid bit is applied to directories.
--info=progress2: Provides detailed progress information, including overall data transfer stats.
--inplace: Writes directly to the destination file, avoiding temporary files (useful for large files).
--exclude='encrypted/docker/frigate-media': Excludes the specified path (relative to the /tank root).
/tank/ /harbor/: Ensures the contents of /tank are copied directly into /harbor.</p>

<h2><a href="#scripture" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="scripture"></a>Scripture</h2>
<p>Luke 2:14 (ESV): 14 “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”</p>
<h2><a href="#edification" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="edification"></a>Edification</h2>
<p>There is a word we probably know - Shalom. It's the Hebrew word we translate often as &quot;peace&quot;. But when I hear &quot;peace&quot; I often think about being calm - and that oversimplifies Shalom... I think a more appropriate understanding is &quot;things are as they are supposed to be&quot;.</p>
<p>In the Garden, we see Shalom - the Lord partnering with humanity to steward the earth, to make things as they were supposed to be...</p>
<p>You all know we messed that up, Shalom was broken and humanity was exiled.</p>
<p>But we have a Great Healer.</p>
<p>Jesus is Lord of all, King of Heaven and Earth, Ruler of your lives and mine, and he is the Prince of Peace</p>
<p>Things in our lives are probably not often as they are supposed to be... We get sick, worry about bills, experience tragedy, and weather the storms of life. But there is hope - confident expectation - that peace already has been, and will continue to be, restored to those whom Jesus chooses, the ones with whom he is pleased.</p>
<p>John records a lot before telling us about the cross, and I won't recount that in this short edification. But he recalls a hopeful word from the Lord -</p>
<p>John 16:33 (LEB): 33 I [Jesus] have said these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but have courage! I have conquered the world.”</p>
<p>This season, and this week of Advent, I pray God presses the reality, and the hope for, peace, the expectation of Shalom, deeper into my heart. I pray the Spirit guides us all to bring the will of God to earth as it is in Heaven</p>
<p>Finally I pray we may all be given, and accept, the conviction of Paul -</p>
<p>Romans 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present trials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven</p>
<p>May the rest, the peace, the Shalom that Jesus gives to his followers be with you all. Amen.</p>

<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible
is no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby
he'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood
by abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a
&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything
like that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of
imagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images
of the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise
man who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds
his house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>
<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or
folly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for
humanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole
earth.</p>
<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it
more fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in
a way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater
humanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look
around if you doubt this truth).</p>
<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on
the rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets
hard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and
I've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those
things bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of
Paul in Romans 8...</p>
<pre><code class="language-Romans">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present
trials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```

By God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the
Love God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver
bullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know
the sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.
