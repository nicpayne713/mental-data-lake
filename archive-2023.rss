<p>Dragons are metaphorical images in the Bible</p>
<p>Goliath -&gt; armor descriptions
Leviathan</p>
<p>Dragon slayers can be enticed to become dragons themselves</p>
<p>Jesus is the great dragon slayer, who doesn't give in to the inticing power of the dragon</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus' victory came through the surrender of his life - which brings him deep
into the dragon's realm, to deliver the ultimate blow</p>
<p>Reflect</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Bible, why is it challenging for humans to slay the dragon? What risks are involved?
The dragon's power is enticing... back to Genesis 3, humans are easy to persuade to do things for personal gain
It's challenging also becauset the dragon is powerful, and humans are not
(without its power or the power of Jesus) so if we stand against it without
the Lord, what hope do we have of victory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the ways that Jesus confronted the “dragon” in his ministry?</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Jesus ultimately defeat the “dragon”? How can we follow his example?</p>
<ul>
<li>Surrender</li>
<li>I think we do the same, but it doesn't always look like death, sometimes it's
subverting the temporary authorities we are under to comply in the least
possible ways while always ultimately striving for the coming of the Kingdom</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Dispersion: διασπορά - same word used by Peter to describe Jesus-followers as exiles</p>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;James 1:2-11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And
let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and
complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that
person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he
is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother
boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a
flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its
scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty

<pre><code>13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him
show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy
and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,
unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there
will be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,
impartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by
those who make peace.

<h2><a href="#december-16" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="december-16"></a>December 16</h2>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;James 5:13-20&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone
cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing
him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will
save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has
committed sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one
another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective
prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being
with the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,
and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he
prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.
19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and
someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner
back from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and
will cover over a great number of sins.

<h3><a href="#when-to-pray" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="when-to-pray"></a>When to pray</h3>
<ol>
<li>All circumstances of life</li>
<li>Sickness</li>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Working out the will of God</li>
<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>
</ol>
<p>James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora
and a life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>
<p>For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I
do not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but
whenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my
attention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus
as well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last
weekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we
needed to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.</p>
<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong> look like. I've
taken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,
accepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What
is prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>
<p>I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've
very consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because
when we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list
situation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need
for him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,
to me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there</p>
<h3><a href="#jc-ryles-quote" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jc-ryles-quote"></a>JC Ryle's quote</h3>
<p>I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only
because the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like
something I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his
children's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone
doesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen
them, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of
forcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.</p>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 1:6&quot;</p>
<pre><code>From the sole of the foot and up to the head
there is no health in it;
bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
and they have not been bound up
and not softened with the oil.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalm 23:5&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5 You prepare before me a table
in the presence of my oppressors.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup is overflowing.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;1 Kings 17:1-16&quot;</p>
<pre><code>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh
lives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be
dew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh
came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must
hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be
that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to
sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.
He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows
were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in
the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that
the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

8 Then the
word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which
belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a
widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to
the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called
to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so
that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,
“Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh
your God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋
in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few
pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we
might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do
according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,
and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.
14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be
emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh
gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according
to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many
days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not
run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of
Elijah.

<p>I was introduced to tiling window managers through i3, which I use heavily on
one of my machines. I have switched to Pop_OS! at home though, which has a
tiling window mode but the keybindings are not what I'm used to for i3. I
wanted to at least navigate workspaces how I'm used to doing (cause I set
workspace 3 for communication apps, 1 for my terminal, etc...)</p>
<p>Here's how I set keybindings for:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;Super&gt; + &lt;number&gt;</code> sends me to that numbered workspace</li>
<li><code>&lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Super&gt; + &lt;number&gt;</code> moves the window I'm focused on to workspace <code>number</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I was getting <code>(publickey denied)</code> when trying to push to GH using ssh. When I
tested the connection I saw that a bunch of keys in ``~/.ssh/ were being
attempted</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">✗ ssh git@github.com -vv

...

debug1: Will attempt key: /home/nic/.ssh/id_rsa 
debug1: Will attempt key: /home/nic/.ssh/id_ecdsa

...

debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).

</code></pre>
<p>None of those were the key I setup with GH. So I added an entry
into <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Host
github.com
User git
Port 22
Hostname github.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_custom_github_key
TCPKeepAlive yes
IdentitiesOnly yes
