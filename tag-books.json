This isn't intended to be in-depth by any stretch.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-1\"></a>Chapter 1</h2>\n<p>&quot;Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen\nincompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn't\nthink of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false', but as 'academic' or\n'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'&quot;</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-2\"></a>Chapter 2</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-3\"></a>Chapter 3</h2>\n<p>pg 11. Keeping the patient's mind focused on the 'inner life' so his actions do\nnot ever reflect his conversion</p>\n<p>pg 12. Creating an imaginary person for whom to pray... &quot;In time, you may get\nthe cleavage so wide that no thought or feeling from his prayers for the\nimagined mother will ever flow over into his treatment of the real one&quot;</p>\n<p>pg 13-14. &quot;Let him assume that she knows how annoying it is and does it to\nannoy - if you know your job he will not notice the immense improbability of\nthe assumption&quot; -&gt; This point is particularly convicting to me</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The last point about encouraging the patient to interpret the mother's every\nmove in an over-sensitive fashion is actually very relatable for me\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-4\"></a>Chapter 4</h2>\n<p>pg 15. Convincing the patient that scheduled prayer is wrong and that he must\ncreate a <em>mood</em> within himself for real prayer reminds me of high school youth\ngroups talking about &quot;praying in the spirit&quot; and silly conversation &quot;combating\nsalvation by works&quot; ideas like scheduled prayer times.</p>\n<p>pg 16. &quot;they constantly forget, what you must always remember, that they are\nanimals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls&quot; ðŸ‘ˆ feels a lot\nlike Genesis 3, and humans are never more human than when we exercise\nself-control.</p>\n<p>pg. 16. &quot;Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce <em>feelings</em>\nthere by the action of their own wills&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I totally remember feeling like I needed to want to pray in order for my\nprayers to matter\n</code></pre>\n<p>pg 17. &quot;When they say they re praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to\nfeel forgiven&quot;</p>\n<p>pg 18. &quot;But whatever the nature of the composite object, you must keep him\npraying to <em>it</em> - to the thing that he has made, not to the Person who has made\nhim&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Lewis talking actual idolatry with meaningful consequences... not the &quot;money\nis my idol&quot; take most pastors preach\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-5\"></a>Chapter 5</h2>\n<p>pg 23. &quot;...while tens of thousands who do not go so far as that will\nnevertheless have their attention diverted from themselves to values and causes\nwhich they believe to be higher than the self. I know that the Enemy\ndisapproves many of these causes. But that is where He is so unfair. He often\nmakes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes He think bad on\nthe monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were\nfollowing the best they knew&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! warning &quot;WARNING TITLE&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>This reminds me of the young Tarkan in Narnia: The Last Battle, who Aslan\nascribes all his good deeds done to Tash as done to himself - effectively\nsaying the Tarkan's loyalty to the wrong god is honored by Aslan? Definitely\nwant to know more about Lewis' thoughts there and here in Screwtape\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-6\"></a>Chapter 6</h2>\n<p>pg 25. &quot;There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's\nmind against the Enemy.&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! warning &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Screwtape's point in the beinning of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\nWormwood to keep the man thinking that the things he is anxious about, the\nthings themselves, are his trials/cross to bear, rather than the anxiety\nitself. So from the Christian perspective, Lewis seems to be saying that the\nreal-time, present, acute anxiety and suspense in the man's heart regarding the\nwar is the actual trial and cross... not the things the man is anxious about. I\ndon't know what to do with this but it _feels_ convicting to me. Growing up I\noften had the thought that nothing could be wrong because &quot;I have Jesus&quot;, and I\nwould look at my circumstances as things to bear - for me the biggest one was\nsingleness. So would Lewis say my outlook on my singleness as the thing to\nbear, rather than the anxiety about being single, was the enemy twisting my\nconvictions to be inward rather than God-ward? It clearly looks like my\nconvictions were inward, but I'm not sure I understand how seeing the anxiety\nitself as my &quot;cross to bare&quot; is any more Biblical...\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-7\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-7\"></a>Chapter 7</h2>\n<p>page 32. &quot;The fact that 'devils' are predominately <em>comic</em> figures in the\nmodern imagination will help you&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I think It's funny because I bet most people, myself included, reading this book (at\nleast the first time) have a red-devil type figure in mind for Screwtape or\nWormwood\n</code></pre>\n<p>page 31-32. &quot;If once we can produce our perfect work -- the Materialist\nMagician, the man, not using, but veritably worshipping, what he vaguely called\n'Froces' while denying the existence of 'spirits' -- then the end of the war\nwill be in sight.&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<p>I hear some non-Christian friends say things like &quot;I'm spiritual so I\nappreciate your prayers&quot;. In a sense they believe in some kind of\nnon-physical &quot;thing&quot; but not in any real sense so it looks, to me, similar to\nwhat Screwtape longs for in his letter to Wormwood.</p>\n<p>page 32. &quot;All extremes, except extreme deviotion to the Enemy, are to be\nencouraged... Other ages, of which the present is one, are unbalanced and prone\nto faction, and it is our business to inflame them&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Using Christianity to justify political positions or judgement seems right\nhere. Extreme devotion to our God I don't think should offend people as often\nor to the degree that many Christians think is right... People flocked to\nJesus, only the religious elite and politically powerful hated him. When\nChristianity is mixed with anything other than itself, that's when it becomes\noffensive. I think I see people hold to something like Christian Nationalism,\nand the offensive nature of it justifies the position because &quot;we were always\ngoing to be persecured for loving Jesus&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! danger &quot;page 34&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Let him begin by treating the Patriotism or the Pacifism as a part of his\nreligion. Then let him, under then influence of partisan spirit, come to\nregard it as the most important part...\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-8\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-8\"></a>Chapter 8</h2>\n<p>!!! success &quot;page 39&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>For He cannot ravish.

The attack has a much better chance of success\nwhen the man's whole innter world is drab and cold and empty.&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I feel this observation in my own life deeply - in my 'troughs' I'm drawn to\npleasurable things in a very unpleasurable way\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! success &quot;page 44&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and\nnormal and satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy's ground.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! danger &quot;jargon not wisdom&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Of course there is no conceivable way of getting by reason from the\nproposition 'I am losing interest in this' to the proposition 'This is\nfalse'/ But, as I said before, it is jargon, not reason, you must rely on.\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-10\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-10\"></a>Chapter 10</h2>\n<p>page 49. &quot;Did he commit himself deeply? I don't mean the words. There is a\nsubtle play of looks and tons and laughs by which a mortal can imply that he is\nof the same party as those to whom he is speaking&quot;</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I resonate with the temptation Scretape is basically instructing Wormwood to\nemploy - two-facedness/double-life. In hs/college in particular I would 'play\nthe part' to fit in to a particular crowd. I'd rarely confess Christianity\nearly on, would never deny it explicitly, but would act and talk in a\nway/about things to imply that I was not necessarily non-Christian, but\ninstead nothing to ask about.\n\nChapter 10 in overall convicting as it just drives home the point I noted\njust now.... that I'm very prone to 'acting' in order to fit into a community\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chatper-11\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chatper-11\"></a>Chatper 11</h2>\n<p>page 55. &quot;The real use of Joke or Humour is in quite a different direction, and\nit is specially promising among the English who take their 'sense of humour' so\nseriously that a deficiency in this sense is almost the only deficiency at\nwhich they feel shame.

When anything is worth laughing\nat, then I think it's very hard to prioritize things above others - becuase\nif everything is a joke, is anything really worthy of more than a joke?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! warning &quot;Flippancy&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I didn't understand flippancy as first because I've always kind of equated\nit with &quot;quick&quot;. However, it's more of a &quot;quickness&quot; paired with a total\nlack of respect/awareness for/of X.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! warning &quot;churches&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Are there areas in the church where we are flippant (specifically with humor I guess?)\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-12\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-12\"></a>Chapter 12</h2>\n<p>!!! danger &quot;page 57-58&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>As long as he retains externally the habits of a Christian he can still be\nmade to think of himself as one who has adopted a few new friends and\namusements but whose spiritual state is much the same as it was six weeks\nago.\n</code></pre>\n<p>page 58. [The dim uneasiness about <code>backsliding</code> Screwtape describes in the\nchapter] increases the patient's reluctance to think about the Enemy.</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>This is too real for me - in seasons of rebellion, and honestly anytime I\nfall away from &quot;Christian habits&quot; I notice that I am actually reluctant to\npray or meditate. Often the only thing that (or the initial thing in\nappearance) that brings me back is my kids and praying with them or singing\nDoxology.

Academic peers of mine, with such amazing pride, speaking aginst the\nBiblical narrative because <em>it doesn't make sense</em>... Lewis makes a good point\nthrough Screwtape &quot;Members of His faction have frequently admitted that if ever\nwe [demons] came to understand what He means by love, the war would be over and\nwe should re-enter Heaven&quot;. I think Lewis' point dovetails with the idea that\nJesus is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive is\na replay of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not\nthe people he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who\nhave everything they think they need... His love is for those who know they are\nlowly</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-19\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-19\"></a>Chapter 19</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: Go through and make notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-20\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-20\"></a>Chapter 20</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: Go through and make notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#chapter-21\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter-21\"></a>Chapter 21</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: Go through and make notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#chatper-22\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chatper-22\"></a>Chatper 22</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: Go through and make notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#chatper-23\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chatper-23\"></a>Chatper 23</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TODO: Go through and make notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#chatper-24\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"chatper-24\"></a>Chatper 24</h2>\n<p>page 130 - It's always the novice who exaggerates...</p>\n<p>!!! background-thought &quot;&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>I think about Summit in particular, where I got to meet a lot of big names in\napologetics, and I'd talk about them to others like we were friends...
