For a while I've been using ansible which makes it easy to manage configuration etc on other machines. But I recently learned about docker contexts and I'm planning to scale down my homelab management to just docker-compose stacks rather than a bunch of super complicated ansible playbooks</p>\n<p>So, setting up a context is easy - it's basically an ssh connection to another machine!</p>\n<p><code>docker context create koober --docker &quot;host=ssh://nic@koober&quot;</code></p>\n<p><code>koober</code> is one of my dev machines and my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> is setup such that I can <code>ssh nic@koober</code>, this makes the context work really seamlessly.</p>\n<p>So there's the <code>default</code> context (the machine you're on) and now I have <code>koober</code></p>\n<p>To use it you run <code>docker context use koober</code></p>\n<p>And then to check we can <code>ls</code> the contexts</p>\n<pre><code>docker context ls\nNAME       DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT               ERROR\ndefault    Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock   \nkoober *                                             ssh://nic@koober\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notice the * - that indicates that's our current context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#trouble\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"trouble\"></a>Trouble</h2>\n<p>Now here's where things get hairy... you've gotta be super-aware of what context you're using.

Truly, I say to you, there will\nnot be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”  \n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:1–2). (2016).

(2016). Crossway Bibles.\n</code></pre>\n<p>At one point in Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple in\nJerusalem, he brings up the Son of Man and Noah...</p>\n<p>Jesus says that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; will be like when Noah built the\nark, and no one understood until the flood (κατακλυσμός | kataklysmos) came and\ntook them away.</p>\n<p>In Jesus' mind the flood narrative gives him imagery and vocabulary to talk\nabout when God allows foreign powers to come and bring judgement... This isn't\nan interpretation of the flood narrative, but it clues us into the idea that\nthe Hebrew bible is full of imagery, like a quilt, that follows a (or several)\npattern(s).</p>\n<pre><code>Jesus understood the flood story as a pattern - a theological category to talk\nabout God overthrowing the corrupt power systems of our world - Tim Mackie\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think sometimes we look at the flood and think God is so bad for taking out\nall of humanity, but we miss the point...

However, you might look for meaning\nthat was never intended to be present.</p>\n<p>The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that\nmight've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else\nsomeone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they\nare telling with their quilt.</p>\n<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be\n&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) <u>repurposed</u> it for that very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#creation-as-a-quilt\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"creation-as-a-quilt\"></a>Creation as a Quilt</h2>\n<p>The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their\ntime and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate the story of the <em>actual</em> God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>\n<p>For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;, but at the very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#calm-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"calm-down\"></a>Calm Down</h2>\n<p>A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they\nknow.</p>\n<p>It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>\n<p>That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and\nnarratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his\nlove for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which starts in the Garden and is how Revelation ends</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible\nis no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby\nhe'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood\nby abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a\n&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything\nlike that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of\nimagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images\nof the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise\nman who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds\nhis house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or\nfolly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for\nhumanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole\nearth.</p>\n<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it\nmore fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in\na way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater\nhumanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look\naround if you doubt this truth).</p>\n<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on\nthe rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets\nhard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and\nI've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those\nthings bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of\nPaul in Romans 8...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Romans\">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present\ntrials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```\n\nBy God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the\nLove God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver\nbullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know\nthe sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord.
