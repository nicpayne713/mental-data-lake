<p>Social media has become a cornerstone of modern communication, allowing individuals to connect across borders and share ideas instantly. However, traditional platforms have raised concerns about censorship, data privacy, and the monopolistic control of user-generated content. <strong>Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays)</strong>, a decentralized social media protocol, offers a revolutionary alternative by emphasizing freedom, privacy, and user autonomy. This essay explores the transformative power of Nostr, why it matters, and provides a practical guide for beginners to get started.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters"></a>The Power of Decentralization: Why Nostr Matters</h3>
<p>At its core, Nostr is a decentralized protocol designed to enable social media functionality without reliance on centralized servers. Unlike traditional platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, which depend on centralized infrastructure owned by corporations, Nostr operates on a peer-to-peer network facilitated by relays. This structural shift offers several key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong><br />
Centralized platforms often act as gatekeepers of content, enforcing moderation policies that can result in censorship. Nostr, on the other hand, allows users to communicate directly without interference from centralized authorities. This makes it particularly valuable for individuals in regions with restrictive speech laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong><br />
On traditional platforms, users sacrifice ownership of their data, which is often monetized by corporations. Nostr empowers users to retain control over their content and personal information by using cryptographic keys to manage identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience Against Shutdowns</strong><br />
Centralized platforms are vulnerable to outages, government intervention, or corporate decisions to deplatform users. Nostr’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity can shut it down, providing a more resilient communication medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open and Transparent Ecosystem</strong><br />
As an open protocol, Nostr allows developers to create interoperable applications and services. This fosters innovation, enabling users to choose from a variety of client applications while maintaining access to the same network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone"></a>How Nostr Works: The Technical Backbone</h3>
<p>Nostr uses a simple yet effective system to transmit messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public and Private Keys</strong>: Each user generates a pair of cryptographic keys. The private key acts as their identity, while the public key serves as their address on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Relays</strong>: These are lightweight servers that broadcast messages. Users send notes (messages) to relays, which distribute them to other users.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong>: Users access Nostr through client applications, which function as user interfaces. Examples include Damus (for mobile) and Amethyst.</li>
</ul>
<p>This decentralized architecture eliminates single points of failure and gives users the flexibility to connect via multiple clients.</p>

<h3><a href="#a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr"></a>A Beginner’s Guide to Getting Started with Nostr</h3>
<p>For those new to Nostr, the decentralized structure might seem intimidating at first. However, with the following step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to join the network and start interacting with others seamlessly.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-1-generate-your-keys" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-1-generate-your-keys"></a>Step 1: Generate Your Keys</h4>
<p>The first step is to create a pair of cryptographic keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: This is your unique identifier and must be kept secret. Treat it like a password.</li>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: This is your &quot;address&quot; on Nostr and can be shared with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Nostr client applications automatically generate these keys for you upon sign-up. Ensure you securely back up your private key, as losing it means losing access to your account permanently.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-2-choose-a-nostr-client" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-2-choose-a-nostr-client"></a>Step 2: Choose a Nostr Client</h4>
<p>Clients are the gateways through which you interact with the Nostr protocol. Popular options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damus</strong> (iOS/Android): User-friendly and feature-rich.</li>
<li><strong>Amethyst</strong> (Android): Tailored for Android users with a sleek interface.</li>
<li><strong>Web Clients</strong>: Platforms like <strong>Nostr.guru</strong> or <strong>Iris</strong> allow you to access Nostr via a browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Install your chosen client and log in using your keys.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-3-connect-to-relays" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-3-connect-to-relays"></a>Step 3: Connect to Relays</h4>
<p>Relays are the backbone of the Nostr network, enabling message distribution. Most clients come pre-configured with default relays, but you can add more for better connectivity and reliability. Simply search for &quot;Nostr relay services&quot; and paste the relay URLs into your client settings.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-4-explore-and-interact" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-4-explore-and-interact"></a>Step 4: Explore and Interact</h4>
<p>Once set up, you can start exploring the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow Users</strong>: Add public keys of other users to your feed.</li>
<li><strong>Post Notes</strong>: Share your thoughts or updates by creating a note, similar to a tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong>: Interact with others by replying to or liking their notes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="#step-5-customize-your-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-5-customize-your-experience"></a>Step 5: Customize Your Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Relays Carefully</strong>: Some relays may specialize in certain topics or enforce content moderation policies. Tailor your relay list based on your interests and values.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Your Keys</strong>: Use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets or encrypted cloud storage to protect your private key.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Clients</strong>: Try multiple clients to find the one that suits your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>After generating a keypair on a nostr app (I started with primal) I copied my
public key to <code>/.well-known/nostr.json</code> and put that at the root of my site at
<code>https://pype.dev</code>.</p>
<p>The file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  “names”: {
    “nic”: “npub1q3fsec2vcv99v80ga72dlv90qwkqmuxqcr6mdyumcmpkgudlhrespyurfj”
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So now I can use <code>nic@pype.dev</code> as on nostr because the client will verify the
pubkey associated with my profile with my domain!</p>

<h2><a href="#genesis-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="genesis-1"></a>Genesis 1</h2>
<p>There is a cyclical pattern of Genesis 1-11.</p>
<p>Introduction 1:1 may be a summary heading rather than the first &quot;verse&quot;.</p>
<h3><a href="#chaos" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="chaos"></a>Chaos</h3>
<p>The narrative begins in 1:2, and the start of everything is a &quot;non-created
world&quot;, which in the ancient mind we should think about as &quot;non-ordered
reality&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>
Genesis 1:2 (LEB): 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was
over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface
of the waters.

Press. 

</code></pre>
<p>תֹּ֫הוּ | to-hu | formless בֹּ֫הוּ | ba-hu | empty, void</p>
<p>The first image is that there is &quot;unordered wild and waste (wasteland)&quot; (we
typically see this as formless and void). There is also &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;,
which is a dark chaotic ocean - and this is the ANE person's conception of
&quot;nothing&quot;. Westerners think &quot;nothing&quot; means &quot;no atmoic particles, no matter&quot;
but the ANE person would've thought about creation as unordered chaos.</p>
<p>God's spirit is hovering over the dark, formless, wild, chaotic ocean.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-1"></a>Day 1</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be light!” And there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it
was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between
the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.  

</code></pre>
<p>Creation starts by separating light from darkness. The darkness is now tamed,
it is apart of an ordered cycle. The ordering of the days is now established
and is repeated in every subsequent day of creation</p>
<h3><a href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-2"></a>Day 2</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be a vaulted dome in the midst of the waters, and let it cause a
separation between the waters.” 7 So God made the vaulted dome, and he caused a
separation between the waters which were under the vaulted dome and between the
waters which were over the vaulted dome. And it was so. 8 And God called the
vaulted dome “heaven.” 

</code></pre>
<p>Then on day 2 he separates &quot;waters from the waters&quot;. God &quot;splits&quot; (Exodus) the
waters, brining order to the chaotic waters.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-3"></a>Day 3</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let the waters under heaven be gathered to one place, and let the dry
ground appear.”

</code></pre>
<p>The waters below are gathered together - so there is further order being
brought to the waters.</p>
<pre><code>
“Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing
fruit ⌊in which there is seed⌋—according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was
so. 12 And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its
kind, and trees bearing fruit ⌊in which there was seed⌋ according to its kind.

</code></pre>
<h4><a href="#bonus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="bonus"></a>Bonus</h4>
<p>Fruit trees (foreshadowing) are then brought up from the lands</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that there are things even in the first 3 days that will be apart of
the narrative going forward</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>So in the first 3 days God has handled the unordered wild and waste</p>
<p>What this cosmos needs now is inhabitants</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-4"></a>Day 4</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven ⌊to separate day from
night⌋, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and
years, 

</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;lights&quot; are clearly the sun, moon, and stars. But they are not called by
those names, they are just called &quot;lights&quot;. Which is the descriptive word מָאוֹר
| ma-or, used to describe the light from the lamp stands in the temple, which
was also a symbol of God's presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice this is <u>not</u> the same word for &quot;light&quot; in the separation of light
and darkness, that is אוֹר | or, not ma-or</p>

<pre><code>
Genesis 1:20–21 (LEB): 20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms
of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the
vaulted dome of heaven.” 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every
living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their
kind, and every bird with wings according to its kind. And God saw that it was
good.

<p>I was debugging some ArgoCD stuff earlier today and I love using k9s to explore
my k8s resources.</p>
<p>The TLDR is that I put some bad env vars in the <code>global</code> values for my ArgoCD
pods, this caused the webUI to hang. An easy way to push things through is to
open k9s, view the Deployments, and edit the env vars there so the pods can be
in the right state to restart and pickup the changes (you've obviously fixed
the values file already right?)</p>
<p>Well the Notification Controller was the pod hanging, and I couldn't find it in
the Deployments view! This blew my mind... until I realized that it was a
Stateful Set.</p>
<p>So, this is not a comparison of the 2 - this is just a note to say that all I
had to do was find the StatefulSets in k9s and do the same workflow for editing
what I needed to edit to get the pods into workable state while working on the
values file...</p>
