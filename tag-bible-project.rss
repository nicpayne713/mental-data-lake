<h2><a href="#genesis-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="genesis-1"></a>Genesis 1</h2>
<p>There is a cyclical pattern of Genesis 1-11.</p>
<p>Introduction 1:1 may be a summary heading rather than the first &quot;verse&quot;.</p>
<h3><a href="#chaos" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="chaos"></a>Chaos</h3>
<p>The narrative begins in 1:2, and the start of everything is a &quot;non-created
world&quot;, which in the ancient mind we should think about as &quot;non-ordered
reality&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>
Genesis 1:2 (LEB): 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was
over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface
of the waters. 

Harris, W. H., III, Ritzema, E., Brannan, R., Mangum, D., Dunham, J., Reimer,
J. A., &amp; Wierenga, M., eds. (2012). The Lexham English Bible (Ge 1:2). Lexham
Press. 

</code></pre>
<p>תֹּ֫הוּ | to-hu | formless בֹּ֫הוּ | ba-hu | empty, void</p>
<p>The first image is that there is &quot;unordered wild and waste (wasteland)&quot; (we
typically see this as formless and void). There is also &quot;darkness&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;,
which is a dark chaotic ocean - and this is the ANE person's conception of
&quot;nothing&quot;. Westerners think &quot;nothing&quot; means &quot;no atmoic particles, no matter&quot;
but the ANE person would've thought about creation as unordered chaos.</p>
<p>God's spirit is hovering over the dark, formless, wild, chaotic ocean.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-1" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-1"></a>Day 1</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be light!” And there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it
was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between
the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.  

</code></pre>
<p>Creation starts by separating light from darkness. The darkness is now tamed,
it is apart of an ordered cycle. The ordering of the days is now established
and is repeated in every subsequent day of creation</p>
<h3><a href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-2"></a>Day 2</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be a vaulted dome in the midst of the waters, and let it cause a
separation between the waters.” 7 So God made the vaulted dome, and he caused a
separation between the waters which were under the vaulted dome and between the
waters which were over the vaulted dome. And it was so. 8 And God called the
vaulted dome “heaven.” 

</code></pre>
<p>Then on day 2 he separates &quot;waters from the waters&quot;. God &quot;splits&quot; (Exodus) the
waters, brining order to the chaotic waters.</p>
<h3><a href="#day-3" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-3"></a>Day 3</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let the waters under heaven be gathered to one place, and let the dry
ground appear.”

</code></pre>
<p>The waters below are gathered together - so there is further order being
brought to the waters.</p>
<pre><code>
“Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing
fruit ⌊in which there is seed⌋—according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was
so. 12 And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its
kind, and trees bearing fruit ⌊in which there was seed⌋ according to its kind.

</code></pre>
<h4><a href="#bonus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="bonus"></a>Bonus</h4>
<p>Fruit trees (foreshadowing) are then brought up from the lands</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that there are things even in the first 3 days that will be apart of
the narrative going forward</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>So in the first 3 days God has handled the unordered wild and waste</p>
<p>What this cosmos needs now is inhabitants</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#day-4" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-4"></a>Day 4</h3>
<pre><code>
“Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven ⌊to separate day from
night⌋, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and
years, 

</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;lights&quot; are clearly the sun, moon, and stars. But they are not called by
those names, they are just called &quot;lights&quot;. Which is the descriptive word מָאוֹר
| ma-or, used to describe the light from the lamp stands in the temple, which
was also a symbol of God's presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice this is <u>not</u> the same word for &quot;light&quot; in the separation of light
and darkness, that is אוֹר | or, not ma-or</p>
</blockquote>

(stars and moon)</p>

<h3><a href="#day-5" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="day-5"></a>Day 5</h3>
<pre><code>
Genesis 1:20–21 (LEB): 20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms
of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the
vaulted dome of heaven.” 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every
living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their
kind, and every bird with wings according to its kind. And God saw that it was
good.

“Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: cattle

<h1><a href="#the-flood-story-and-jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-flood-story-and-jesus"></a>The Flood Story and Jesus</h1>
<p>Jesus brings up the Flood story from Genesis just one time (in the recorded teachings we have).</p>
<p>First to set the scene, Jesus and his disciples are visiting the temple, and the disiples are kind of &quot;ooo-ing&quot; and &quot;aaah-ing&quot; when Jesus tells them about about the coming destruction...</p>
<pre><code>Matthew 24:1–2 (ESV):  24 Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his
disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. 2 But he
answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will
not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”  

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:1–2). (2016). Crossway Bibles.

</code></pre>
<pre><code>Matthew 24:37–39 (ESV): 37 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming
of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered
the ark, 39 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away,
so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:37–39). (2016). Crossway Bibles.
</code></pre>
<p>At one point in Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple in
Jerusalem, he brings up the Son of Man and Noah...</p>
<p>Jesus says that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; will be like when Noah built the
ark, and no one understood until the flood (κατακλυσμός | kataklysmos) came and
took them away.</p>
<p>In Jesus' mind the flood narrative gives him imagery and vocabulary to talk
about when God allows foreign powers to come and bring judgement... This isn't
an interpretation of the flood narrative, but it clues us into the idea that
the Hebrew bible is full of imagery, like a quilt, that follows a (or several)
pattern(s).</p>
<pre><code>Jesus understood the flood story as a pattern - a theological category to talk
about God overthrowing the corrupt power systems of our world - Tim Mackie
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I think sometimes we look at the flood and think God is so bad for taking out
all of humanity, but we miss the point... God is RESTORING humanity by
removing corruption... that's eventually the story we're invited into via
faith in Jesus</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="types"></a>Types</h2>
<p>A <code>type</code> is a category of prophecy, and an <code>antitype</code> is the revelation of the type.</p>
<p>Essentially - a <code>type</code> is a pattern, and the <code>antytype</code> is the revelation of
the meaning of the pattern - and without understanding the preceding types (in
this case, the flood) then the antitype cannot be understood (in this case
baptism)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a trivial example of how a type, or a pattern, can be noticed and even build
anticipation is to think 2, 4, 6, 8... what comes next? 10, and we all know
that immediately. Types in general, and types in the Bible are no different,
albeit not so simple...</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#flood-and-baptism" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="flood-and-baptism"></a>Flood and Baptism</h2>
<p>Brace yourself...</p>
<pre><code>1 Peter 3:18–22 (ESV): 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous
for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which he went and proclaimed to the
spirits in prison, 20 because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience
waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few,
that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which
corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but
as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with
angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.  

The Holy Bible: English Standard Version (1 Pe 3:18–22). (2016). Crossway
Bibles.
</code></pre>
<p>Notice verse 21 - &quot;Baptism, which <u>corresponds</u> to this&quot;</p>
<p>Corresponds is the word ἀντίτυπος (antitupos) in Greek, which means &quot;anti-type&quot;
This means clearly that the <code>type</code>, or <em>a</em> type, for baptism, is the flood
narrative... or that baptism is the antitype for the flood</p>
<p>What does this mean for baptism?</p>
<pre><code>21 Baptism, which
corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but
as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with
angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him
</code></pre>
<p>Through baptism, we experience with Jesus, resurrection and rule of the angels,
authorities, and power of the world...</p>
<h2><a href="#take-away" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="take-away"></a>Take Away</h2>
<p>For the disciples listening... are they arguing about when the flood happened?
or if it was a global or local flood?</p>
<p>No... they are listening to Jesus unpack patterns in the Bible and they hear
him invite them, through a story they know very well, into rule and reign with
him</p>

<h1><a href="#the-flood-story-in-the-hebrew-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-flood-story-in-the-hebrew-bible"></a>The Flood Story in the Hebrew Bible</h1>
<p>I'm slowly making my way through some Bible Project classes online because Tim
Mackie is a fantastic teacher and BP has done be a <em>great</em> service by opening
my eyes to the reality of the Biblical narrative and what it means for my life
of faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>The second session is filled with great points and 10 minutes in I had to jot
this one down...</p>
<h2><a href="#a-quilt-as-history" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="a-quilt-as-history"></a>A Quilt as History</h2>
<p>Imagine your grandmother's grandmother made a quilt, and passed it down the
family tree. In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date you
but would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning
that was never intended to be present.</p>
<p>The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that
might've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else
someone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they
are telling with their quilt.</p>
<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they
come from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what
those pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The
creator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be
&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an
article of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the
author (your grandma) <u>repurposed</u> it for that very reason, to change the
meaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different
than what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.</p>
<h2><a href="#creation-as-a-quilt" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="creation-as-a-quilt"></a>Creation as a Quilt</h2>
<p>The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor
home very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew
scripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their
time and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to
communicate the story of the <em>actual</em> God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>
<p>For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the
spirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than
a short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not
only that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where
their savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her
eventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have
to fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension
with creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters
that other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of
the waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the
stories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;, but at the very least made them
relevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and
Lord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner
with him (as his image-bearers).</p>
<h2><a href="#calm-down" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="calm-down"></a>Calm Down</h2>
<p>A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get
brought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English
translation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the
Word of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for
himself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they
know.</p>
<p>It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of
what's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's
parallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly
communicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks
order into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation
narratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>
<p>That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,
carried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and
narratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his
love for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>
<ul>
<li>which starts in the Garden and is how Revelation ends</li>

<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible
is no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby
he'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood
by abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a
&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything
like that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of
imagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images
of the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise
man who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds
his house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>
<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or
folly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for
humanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole
earth.</p>
<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it
more fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in
a way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater
humanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look
around if you doubt this truth).</p>
<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on
the rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets
hard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and
I've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those
things bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of
Paul in Romans 8...</p>
<pre><code class="language-Romans">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present
trials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```

By God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the
Love God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver
bullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know
the sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.

<pre><code>24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

<h2><a href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="reflection"></a>Reflection</h2>
<p>From the visual commentary Tim calls out a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>the rock</code> is supposed to first call us back to earlier in the sermon when Jesus calls his people &quot;the light of the world&quot; and says &quot;a city on a hill [mountain] cannot be hidden&quot; (Matthew 5:14). The hill [ὄρος | oros] means &quot;mountain&quot; and is a hyperlink to OT teaching of God's people living in the ideal Jerusalem on Mt. Zion. Lots of Hebrew imagery here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rain and floods are a callback to the Chaos Waters of the OT (and general ANE thinking). It's a reference to the destructive nature that we humans have unleashed on the world - but the wise man who listens to Jesus lives a life with some amount of protection from those hardships - and ultimate protection from God handing us over to Chaos (destruction).</p>

<p>I know there's a lot more to where the texts come from and the varying

we all know, deep down, how to live in harmony but that it requires sacrifice.
He calls us to live sacrificially <em>towards each other</em>, to live in Heaven
today, so we can experience the coming reality if our own resurrection</p>

<h2><a href="#passage" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="passage"></a>Passage</h2>
<pre><code>Why do you see the speck in the eye of your brother, but you don't perceive the
beam in your own eye?

Or how can you say to your brother, &quot;Allow me to take out the speck from your
eye,&quot; and look, the beam is in your eye!

Hypocrite! First take out the beam from your eye, and then you can see clearly
the speck in the eye of your brother.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be
hopend to you. For the one who asks will receive, and the one who seeks will
find. And to the one who knocks it will be opened. For what person is among
you, who when their son asks for break, will give him a rock? Or when he asks
for a fish will give him a snake? So then fi you all are bad, but you know how
to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the
skies give good things to those who ask.
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="reflection"></a>Reflection</h2>
<p>James builds on this with <code>if any of you lacks wisdom then ask for wisdom it will be given to you</code>. James is arming us with some specifics from the Sermon
on the Mount. We aren't just to ask for anything that we think is good...
wisdom is the good we are to ask for.</p>
<p>Tim: Prayer is important because wisdom will flow out of a deep interpersonal
relationship with God.</p>
<h3><a href="#where-has-god-given-me-wisdom" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="where-has-god-given-me-wisdom"></a>Where has God given me wisdom?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Marriage/relationships as Kassia and I have navigated many things (job changes, moving for family, family falling through, unhealthy parent relationships, church hunts, and our own self-development and discovery)</li>
<li>He's given me a lot of professional wisdom - potentially through AuDHD and the exposure he's brought me through.</li>
<li>Through Mark Forstrom, Andrew, Nick Z, etc. I was filled with wisdom on how to be a man in the life of a boy - how to talk with someone immature, let them be and feel heard, but also on how to challenge them to grow (up).</li>

<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video.
The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are
unobtrusive.</p>
<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>
<pre><code class="language-Do">that you judge, you will be judged.

And with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you. ```

There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an
AuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost
certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of
Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying
he'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew
7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - `do unto
others as you would have them do unto you` is how my Souther Baptist Grandma
used to say it.

I've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live
Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at
non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally
what I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty
unreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double
standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do
you take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own
eye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely
don't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get
older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a
position of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my
family is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people
living their lives.

The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is
directionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a
kid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly
driven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt
responsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of
God's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my
time thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will
save who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage
- my own life and family.

<p>God's kingdom was to be ushered into the world by his creation, but Genesis
3,6,10 tell us that humans choose wrong when we define good and bad by
ourselves. Yahweh chose Abraham and built up Israel as a second attempt of
sorts to bring the his Kingdom to earth but the HB is filled with the story of
how they mostly failed.</p>
<p>NT time is where Jesus reveals the Kingdom to Jews who are oppressed by Roman
Empire and he reveals this to exactly the oppressed audience - &quot;Blessed are the
poor in spirit&quot;</p>

<p>Dragons are metaphorical images in the Bible</p>
<p>Goliath -&gt; armor descriptions
Leviathan</p>
<p>Dragon slayers can be enticed to become dragons themselves</p>
<p>Jesus is the great dragon slayer, who doesn't give in to the inticing power of the dragon</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus' victory came through the surrender of his life - which brings him deep
into the dragon's realm, to deliver the ultimate blow</p>
<p>Reflect</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Bible, why is it challenging for humans to slay the dragon? What risks are involved?
The dragon's power is enticing... back to Genesis 3, humans are easy to persuade to do things for personal gain
It's challenging also becauset the dragon is powerful, and humans are not
(without its power or the power of Jesus) so if we stand against it without
the Lord, what hope do we have of victory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the ways that Jesus confronted the “dragon” in his ministry?</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Jesus ultimately defeat the “dragon”? How can we follow his example?</p>
<ul>
<li>Surrender</li>
<li>I think we do the same, but it doesn't always look like death, sometimes it's
subverting the temporary authorities we are under to comply in the least
possible ways while always ultimately striving for the coming of the Kingdom</li>

<p>This class is not so much a survey of the HB, it is Tim's attempt to distil the
most helpful things for understanding it in a consumable way for laypeople.</p>
<p>A chunk of this is the other people giving some of their own background. One
lady said something that might be helpful for ministry - &quot;Maybe that thing that
I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'&quot;</p>

<pre><code>Maybe that thing that I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'
</code></pre>
<p>!!! danger &quot;Christian coping strategy for the Olt Testament&quot;</p>
<pre><code>1. Hero-example model
    * Stories get isolated and distilled down into a simple moral model, where the hero is just the hero.
    * Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense
    * There's something correct about this - but the oversimplification usually comes out of a massive re-writting of the stories, then anyone raised on those versions of the story is scaldalized when they read it for real

2. Poltical-authority source
    * Political parties hijacking &quot;The Bible says X about Y&quot; as a means to harvest authority from a book that many people claim is authoritative.

3. Theology answer book model
    * Treating the Bible like a dictionary of key/value pairs where keys are questions and values are simple answers.
    * This ignores narrative, and general literacy.
    * The instinct may be right - the Bible should profoundly shape my view of everything, but it isn't simple

4. Inspirational-heart-warming model
    * Verse-a-day calendars
    * Jermiah 29:11
</code></pre>
<p>!!! warning &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Are we imposing a set of questions that are foreign to what the authors are
trying to communicate? do we need to set our cultural agendas aside to just
listen?
</code></pre>
<p>A result of asking the wrong questions is the common story of people's faith being dismantled <em>by reading the Bible</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible&quot;</p>
<pre><code>One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
side the New Testament? —

<h2><a href="#session-2-how-jesus-and-the-apostle-readtheir-bibles" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session-2-how-jesus-and-the-apostle-readtheir-bibles"></a>Session 2: How Jesus and the Apostle ReadTheir Bibles</h2>
<p>The Bible most often refers to itself as <em>the Writings</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Road to Emmaus&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus confronts a couple guys walking to Emmaus after he is resurrected and
more or less calls them idiots/fools for not understanding that the
Writings point to an annointed king who will suffer death for the sake of
redemption. He's recognized by them once their eyes are opened then he vanishes
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Weird stuff</strong></p>
<h3><a href="#paul-and-timothy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="paul-and-timothy"></a>Paul and Timothy</h3>
<p>Paul assumes when writing to Timothy that he, and probably believers in general, are in a community of people who are regularly learning about Yahweh through the Scriptures <em>as a family</em></p>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Timothy 3:15-16&quot;</p>
<pre><code>... and that from childhood you ahve known the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leas to salvation through faith which is
in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness
</code></pre>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>For Paul, the `Scriptures` here are our OT, the Hebrew Bible. For Paul, the HB
is entirely _wisdom literature_ that leads to salvation through Jesus
</code></pre>
<p>The question of &quot;What are the Scriptures?&quot; is covered in the next session</p>
<p><strong>To answer the question 'How do we read the HB?' we have to ask the question
'Whose book is the HB?'</strong></p>
<h2><a href="#session-3-shape-of-the-scriptures" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session-3-shape-of-the-scriptures"></a>Session 3: Shape of the Scriptures</h2>
<p><code>Old Testament</code> is the Christian term for a set of writings that comprise about
3/4 of the Christian Bible. The authors themselves though refer to those
writings as <code>the Scriptures</code>. One time it is called <code>the Old Covenant</code> by Paul
, but he's talking about Synagogue readings of the Torah portion in synagogues.
THe phrase <code>Hebrew Bible</code> is a modern term that is a bit more neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what is our Bible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 24:25-27&quot;</p>
<pre><code>25 And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary
that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in
all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 11:49–51 (ESV) &quot;</p>
<pre><code>49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood
of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged
against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell
you, it will be required of this generation.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Jesus pick these two events? Abel is murdered on page 4, Zechariah is
murdered in the last part of Chronicles, which in the TaNaK is significant...
Jesus is saying that <em>all the prophets from the beginning of the Scriptures to
the end</em>... All the prophets from A-Z so to speak</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Scriptures&quot;</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Books&quot; as we know it, bound papers with writing on it, called a 'codex'
wasn't a thing until a couple hundred years post-Jesus... so when the
authors say &quot;The Scriptures&quot; we need to keep in mind that Jews had the
scriptures in their minds and hearts, not on paper (save for a couple very
expensive scrolls). So the structure of the scriptures is also apart of the
Jewish being... This interaction with the Scriptures is _very very very
different than how we interact with the Bible_

<h2><a href="#session-4---seams-between-texts-in-the-dead-sea-scrolls" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session-4---seams-between-texts-in-the-dead-sea-scrolls"></a>Session 4 - Seams between Texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls</h2>
<p>Around 100-200 AD there was a split in the Jewish community over things like
how the Temple and sacrifices were to be run, etc. A group got kicked out, so
they grabbed some scrolls and went to start what we'd think of as a Monastic
community. Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group
managed are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own
writings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.</p>
<p>The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran. They were
found in the 1940s by a bunch of shepherds. A few showed up online for sale and
that's how we found out about their exitence.... These scrolls give us
pre-Christian Jewish Bible nerds...</p>
<p>Qumran community didn't know about Jesus - they thought the Messiah would be a
man called <em>The Teacher of Righteousness</em></p>
<h3><a href="#scroll-making" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="scroll-making"></a>Scroll-making</h3>
<p>The DSS preserved for us, not only ancient biblical texts, but also the method
by which scrolls were created. They were well-preserved papyrus that was
stiched together - literal stitches. We also have obvious additions from Qumran
community as well as notes from priests and corrections from missed
transcribing.</p>
<h3><a href="#our-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="our-bible"></a>Our Bible</h3>
<p>The DSS scrolls, being the oldest stitched together set of scrolls, teach us
how scrolls and collections of ancient holy texts were put together. We need to
keep this in mind when we think about where our Christian Bible came from</p>
<p>The beginning and ending of our books might/are filled with hyperlinks that
call a reader's mind back to other stories. It's the way of linking context and
stories to one another before the writings are in a codex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hyperlinks - language/syntax that remind a reader of antoher scroll - help us
understand the structure of the Hebrew Bible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! note &quot;A favorite quote from Tim&quot;</p>
<pre><code>So, you can see I'm interested in a historical question of like the
collection [Hebrew Bible] was produced by a group of people. What did they
mean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate
them and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what
they're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you
that—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all
points to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the
apostles talk about these texts.
So that's different from saying nobody
knew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go
reread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It
seems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting
and complicated than that.  [17:30-18:21]

<p>I think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His
faithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a
kid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,
and my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my
children - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or
worldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -
he sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand
faithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my
faithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that
<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>

<pre><code>God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that
would rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom
collapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the
beginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What
do you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?

, Hebrews 11
Hebrews 11

The Triumphs of Faith

1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.

3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.

13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.

17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.

23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.

30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.

32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

, and Hebrews 12:1-3
Hebrews 12:1-3

Jesus, the Example

1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

. After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.

<p>Brougt to completion on the seventh day in Genesis 1. It is the only day that
does not end with 'there evening and there was morning, the Nth day'</p>
<p>Humans were meant to rest with God in his creation forever, but in their
rebllion they are sentenced to work as slaves to the land. The rest of the
hsitory of God's people consists of them looking for God's rest, but
consistently falling back into slavery/(fallen) work.</p>
<h2><a href="#sabbath" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="sabbath"></a>Sabbath</h2>
<p>Celebated every week on the 7th day. The idea is to live in the eternal rest that God offered in creation.</p>
<h2><a href="#jubilee" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jubilee"></a>Jubilee</h2>
<p>Every 7 * 7 years is the Ultimate Sabbath - the land is reset (or was supposed
to be), everything was returned to the original owner, debt does not persist -
everything resets so everyone can rest.</p>
<h1><a href="#jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jesus"></a>Jesus</h1>
<p>Jesus calls himself the Lord of the Sabbath. He claimed to bring the ultimate
rest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time - on Good Friday, and he
rose again on the following Sunday... which is the first day of the next week
<em>or</em> the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate
sabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.</p>

19There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

23There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

31God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was
evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

The Creation of Man and Woman

1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By
the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on
the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the
seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work
which God had created and made.

<p>I imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at
things I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order in my
hobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive but
not toilsome.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Genesis 3:1-7,21-24&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Fall of Man

1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord
God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall
not eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2The woman said to the serpent,
“From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit
of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall
not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 4The serpent said to the
woman, “You surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat
from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
and evil.” 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband
with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they
knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made
themselves loin coverings. 

21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam
and his wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man
has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch
out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live
forever”— 23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to
cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;
and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the
flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of
life.
</code></pre>
<p>Humans are templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information
they are templted to <em>be like God</em>. They are templted to believe that they
would be right to knowing good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>
<p>They acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they
chose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and
obvious rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go
their own way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>
<p>It seems like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define
good and evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as
good - made obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not
listen to Yahweh. Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a
lot to discussing &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am
simply less tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good
and bad</p>

male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with

And recovery of sight to the blind,

<pre><code>The Sabbatic Year and Year of Jubilee

1The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, 2“Speak to the sons
of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I shall give
you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord. 3Six years you shall
sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in
its crop, 4but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest,
a sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your
vineyard. 5Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes
of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical
year. 6All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food;
yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your
foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you. 7Even your cattle and
the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.

8‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven
times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of
years, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad
on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall
sound a horn all through your land. 10You shall thus consecrate the
fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its
inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to
his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall
have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its
aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;
it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.

13‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.
14If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend’s
hand, you shall not wrong one another. 15Corresponding to the number of
years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to
you according to the number of years of crops. 16In proportion to the
extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the
fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of
crops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another, but you
shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.

18‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry
them out, that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will
yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.
20But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do
not sow or gather in our crops?” 21then I will so order My blessing for you
in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years. 22When
you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop,
eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.

The Law of Redemption

23‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;
for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of
your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.

25‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of
his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his
relative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his
means as to find sufficient for its redemption, 27then he shall calculate
the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold
it, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not found sufficient
means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the
hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it
shall revert, that he may return to his property.

29‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his
redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right
of redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him
within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city
passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not
revert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no
surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption
rights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the
Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities
which are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may
be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the
jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession
among the sons of Israel. 34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be
sold, for that is their perpetual possession.

Of Poor Countrymen

35‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard
to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,
that he may live with you. 36Do not take usurious interest from him, but
revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. 37You shall not
give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. 38I am the Lord
your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of
Canaan and to be your God.

39‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he
sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. 40He
shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve
with you until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and
his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to
the property of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants whom I brought
out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You
shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. 44As for
your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and
female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it
is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you
may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they
will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession.
46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a
possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your
countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one
another.

Of Redeeming a Poor Man

47‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes
sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as
to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the
descendants of a stranger’s family, 48then he shall have redemption right
after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,
or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his
family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then
with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to
him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond
to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be
with him. 51If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his
purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 52and if few
years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In
proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.
53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule
over him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed by these
means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with
him. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I
brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

<h1><a href="#chara--joy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="chara--joy"></a>Chara / Joy</h1>
<p>There are several words for similar feelings - example like <code>joy</code> has several synonyms.</p>
<h2><a href="#sources" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="sources"></a>Sources</h2>
<p>Genesis tells us creation and life bring joy
Psalm 104 - A good bottle of wine is God's gift to bring joy to people's hearts
P#lm 65 - Beautiful things bring joy
Jeremiah 33:11 - Weddings</p>
<h2><a href="#corruption" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="corruption"></a>Corruption</h2>
<p>Bible shows us that humanity and brokenness mark our world by death and loss</p>
<h2><a href="#joy-in-spite-of-corruption" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="joy-in-spite-of-corruption"></a>Joy in spite of corruption</h2>
<p>God's people have reasons in God's faithfulness to be joyful.
Joy in the LORD is not determinmed by current struggles, but by future hope and deliverance</p>
<h2><a href="#jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jesus"></a>Jesus</h2>
<p>His birth gives good news and brings great joy</p>
<p>Matthew 5 - Jesus says to rejoice and be glad when we are persecuted for his Name</p>
<h2><a href="#apostles" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="apostles"></a>Apostles</h2>
<p>Paul says he chooses joy when he is in jail</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy is a _choice_
</code></pre>
<p>2 Corinthians 6:10 -&gt; Paul is filled with sorrow and yet rejoicing</p>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Christian joy is rooted in future hope and expectation of a Messiah, of
Jesus, to come again. It is a profound choice, not the result of current
circumstances
</code></pre>
<h1><a href="#questions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="questions"></a>Questions</h1>
<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Israelites choose a path apart from God. As a result, they get exiled
from their land and dominated by foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah
knew that sorrow would not have the final word with these people. He looked
forward to the day when Yahweh would end pain and corruption to lead them
into endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and Isaiah 51:11 . What does
Isaiah tell us about God’s character in these passages? What does Isaiah
say will happen to God’s people?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 49:13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!

Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!

For the Lord has comforted His people

And will have compassion on His afflicted.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 51:11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>11So the ransomed of the Lord will return

And come with joyful shouting to Zion,

And everlasting joy will be on their heads.

They will obtain gladness and joy,

And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
</code></pre>
<p>Isiah tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past
faithfulness - <code>For the Lord _has_ comforted His people</code> as well as future
faithfulness - <code>So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...</code></p>
<p>Isiah leans in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's <code>hesed</code>, his
<strong>steadfase love</strong>, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than
any powerful but fickle diety.</p>
<p>Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages, promise or claim a promise of any
kind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing in reflecting on
God's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's deliverance.
God's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of their bondage.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel’s redeemer. His
prophecies were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why
were the shepherds afraid? What reasons did the angels give for them to
rejoice instead?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 2:9-11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the
Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
</code></pre>
<p>Presumably the shepherds were afraid because of <code>the glory of the Lord</code>. All
throughout the OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,
specifically on Sinai. Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown
Yahweh's back due to his glory, and then Moses has to veil his face so that the
glory of the Lord persisted on him would not terrify the Israelites.</p>
<p>The angels outright said that a Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.
There is no greater cause for joy than the king of creation returning</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
and his promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3
. According to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain
joy even through painful or dire situations?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
and his promises.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Matthew 5:11-12&quot;</p>
<pre><code>11“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely
say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be glad, for
your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the
prophets who were before you.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Acts 13:50-52&quot;</p>
<pre><code>50But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men
of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
drove them out of their district. 51But they shook off the dust of their
feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. 52And the disciples were
continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Hebrews 12:1-3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus, the Example

1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let
us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles
us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing
our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set
before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the
right hand of the throne of God. 3For consider Him who has endured such
hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and
lose heart.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Harsh treatment of us, particularly for faith, reflects Jesus' life. We stand
with God-incarnate in living for a different kingdom which has negative
consequences for us in the modern age, but obviously not in God's age that's
already here and yet coming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy Spirit gives us joy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives, struggled
with God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's own
grace. Similarly we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's
<code>hesed</code> love.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>
<pre><code>When we see how Jesus’ loving way of life has overcome death itself, joy
starts to become strangely reasonable. But this doesn’t mean it is wise to
ignore or suppress sorrow. Read 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul
integrate both joy and sorrow?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Corinthians 6:3-10&quot;</p>
<pre><code>3giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be
discredited, 4but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in
much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings,
in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 6in
purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in
genuine love, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of
righteousness for the right hand and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by
evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true; 9as
unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not
put to death, 10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many
rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.

<h1><a href="#video" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="video"></a>Video</h1>
<h2><a href="#priests" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="priests"></a>Priests</h2>
<p>God creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal image - priests. God
sets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their own way. The
promise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.</p>
<p>God chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen
by God to bless all the nations.</p>
<h2><a href="#melchizedek" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="melchizedek"></a>Melchizedek</h2>
<p>A priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -
Abraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the story</p>
<p>Salem is ancient short name for Jerusalem.
Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the
Levites (priests) to support them.</p>
<h2><a href="#royal-family" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="royal-family"></a>Royal Family</h2>
<p>Abraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take amtters into
their own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,
Issac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents God
challenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own
way with Sarah</p>
<p>DUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place &quot;God will provide&quot;.</p>
<h2><a href="#types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="types"></a>Types</h2>
<p>The story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham
meeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham meets a priest on a high
place and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest
and a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers the sins of Abraham's family.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Atonement and Covering&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve
rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a
grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the
'covering' is simply a sign of forgiveness

<pre><code>Shalem, or Salem, is later known as Jerusalem. Moriah, a mountainous region in
Jerusalem, is later called the “mount of the LORD” (Genesis 22:14) and the
“temple mount” (2 Chronicles 3:1). With all of this in mind, compare Genesis
14:17-20 with Genesis 22:1-14 . How do you see God providing for Abraham in
these similar settings?

<pre><code>God’s Promise to Abram

17Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who
were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of
Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18And Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. 19He
blessed him and said,

“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,

Possessor of heaven and earth;

20And blessed be God Most High,

Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”

He gave him a tenth of all.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Genesis 22:1-14&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Offering of Isaac

1Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to
him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2He said, “Take now your son,
your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and
offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will
tell you.” 3So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,
and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood
for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had
told him. 4On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from
a distance. 5Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and
I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”
6Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son,
and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked
on together. 7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And
he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 8Abraham said, “God will
provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of
them walked on together. 

9Then they came to the place of which God had told
him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his
son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10Abraham
stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel
of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he
said, “Here I am.” 12He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the
lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you
have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 13Then Abraham raised
his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by
his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt
offering in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of that place
The Lord Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord
it will be provided.”

<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>As you review Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that
Jesus is better than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the
author provides? How is this good news for everyone?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Hebrews 7&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s

1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.

4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.

11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,

“You are a priest forever

According to the order of Melchizedek.”

18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,

“The Lord has sworn

And will not change His mind,

‘You are a priest forever’ ”);

22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.

23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.

26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Melchizedek was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>
<li>Melchizedek was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>
<li>Levitical priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>
<li>Former priests, Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably died)</li>
