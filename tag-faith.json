Truly, I say to you, there will\nnot be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”  \n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:1–2). (2016).

(2016). Crossway Bibles.\n</code></pre>\n<p>At one point in Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple in\nJerusalem, he brings up the Son of Man and Noah...</p>\n<p>Jesus says that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; will be like when Noah built the\nark, and no one understood until the flood (κατακλυσμός | kataklysmos) came and\ntook them away.</p>\n<p>In Jesus' mind the flood narrative gives him imagery and vocabulary to talk\nabout when God allows foreign powers to come and bring judgement... This isn't\nan interpretation of the flood narrative, but it clues us into the idea that\nthe Hebrew bible is full of imagery, like a quilt, that follows a (or several)\npattern(s).</p>\n<pre><code>Jesus understood the flood story as a pattern - a theological category to talk\nabout God overthrowing the corrupt power systems of our world - Tim Mackie\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think sometimes we look at the flood and think God is so bad for taking out\nall of humanity, but we miss the point... God is RESTORING humanity by\nremoving corruption... that's eventually the story we're invited into via\nfaith in Jesus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#types\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"types\"></a>Types</h2>\n<p>A <code>type</code> is a category of prophecy, and an <code>antitype</code> is the revelation of the type.</p>\n<p>Essentially - a <code>type</code> is a pattern, and the <code>antytype</code> is the revelation of\nthe meaning of the pattern - and without understanding the preceding types (in\nthis case, the flood) then the antitype cannot be understood (in this case\nbaptism)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a trivial example of how a type, or a pattern, can be noticed and even build\nanticipation is to think 2, 4, 6, 8... what comes next? 10, and we all know\nthat immediately.

In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date you\nbut would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning\nthat was never intended to be present.</p>\n<p>The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that\nmight've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else\nsomeone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they\nare telling with their quilt.</p>\n<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be\n&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) <u>repurposed</u> it for that very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#creation-as-a-quilt\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"creation-as-a-quilt\"></a>Creation as a Quilt</h2>\n<p>The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their\ntime and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate the story of the <em>actual</em> God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>\n<p>For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;, but at the very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#calm-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"calm-down\"></a>Calm Down</h2>\n<p>A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they\nknow.</p>\n<p>It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>\n<p>That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and\nnarratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his\nlove for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which starts in the Garden and is how Revelation ends</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby\nhe'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood\nby abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a\n&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything\nlike that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of\nimagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images\nof the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise\nman who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds\nhis house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or\nfolly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for\nhumanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole\nearth.</p>\n<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it\nmore fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in\na way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater\nhumanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look\naround if you doubt this truth).</p>\n<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on\nthe rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets\nhard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and\nI've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those\nthings bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of\nPaul in Romans 8...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Romans\">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present\ntrials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```\n\nBy God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the\nLove God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver\nbullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know\nthe sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.\n\n&lt;!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer --&gt;\n\n[github]: https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite\n</code></pre>\n",

These 2 verses are in a larger section of\nScripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying\nhe'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew\n7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - `do unto\nothers as you would have them do unto you` is how my Souther Baptist Grandma\nused to say it.\n\nI've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live\nBiblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at\nnon-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally\nwhat I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty\nunreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double\nstandards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do\nyou take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own\neye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely\ndon't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get\nolder or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a\nposition of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my\nfamily is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people\nliving their lives.\n\nThe BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is\ndirectionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a\nkid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly\ndriven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt\nresponsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of\nGod's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my\ntime thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will\nsave who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage\n- my own life and family.\n\n&lt;!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer --&gt;\n\n[github]: https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite\n</code></pre>\n",

The effective\nprayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being\nwith the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,\nand it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he\nprayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.\n19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and\nsomeone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner\nback from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and\nwill cover over a great number of sins.\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"#when-to-pray\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"when-to-pray\"></a>When to pray</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>All circumstances of life</li>\n<li>Sickness</li>\n<li>Confession</li>\n<li>Working out the will of God</li>\n<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>\n<p>For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.</p>\n<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong> look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>\n<p>I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#jc-ryles-quote\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"jc-ryles-quote\"></a>JC Ryle's quote</h3>\n<p>I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.</p>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 1:6&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>From the sole of the foot and up to the head\nthere is no health in it;\nbruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,\nand they have not been bound up\nand not softened with the oil.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalm 23:5&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5 You prepare before me a table\nin the presence of my oppressors.\nYou anoint my head with oil;\nmy cup is overflowing.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;1 Kings 17:1-16&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh\nlives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be\ndew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh\ncame to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must\nhide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be\nthat you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to\nsustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.\nHe went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows\nwere bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in\nthe evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that\nthe wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\n\n8 Then the\nword of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which\nbelongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a\nwidow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to\nthe gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called\nto her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so\nthat I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,\n“Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh\nyour God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋\nin the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few\npieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we\nmight eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do\naccording to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,\nand bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.\n14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be\nemptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh\ngives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according\nto the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many\ndays. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not\nrun out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of\nElijah.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

What did they\nmean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate\nthem and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what\nthey're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you\nthat—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all\npoints to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the\napostles talk about these texts.\nSo that's different from saying nobody\nknew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go\nreread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It\nseems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting\nand complicated than that.

I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that\n<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\nwould rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom\ncollapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\nbeginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\ndo you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Samuel 7:16&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;PSALM 89&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The Lord’s Covenant with David, and Israel’s Afflictions.\n\nA Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.\n\n1I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;\n\nTo all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.\n\n2For I have said, “Lovingkindness will be built up forever;\n\nIn the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”\n\n3“I have made a covenant with My chosen;\n\nI have sworn to David My servant,\n\n4I will establish your seed forever\n\nAnd build up your throne to all generations.” Selah.\n\n5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;\n\nYour faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.\n\n6For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord?\n\nWho among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,\n\n7A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,\n\nAnd awesome above all those who are around Him?\n\n8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord?\n\nYour faithfulness also surrounds You.\n\n9You rule the swelling of the sea;\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Ultimately, God answers the psalmist’s cries in the person of Jesus.

How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John 1:14\nJohn 1:14\n\nThe Word Made Flesh\n\n14And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\n, Hebrews 3:5-6\nHebrews 3:5-6\n\n5Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.\n\n, and Romans 15:8-9\nRomans 15:8-9\n\n8For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written,\n\n“Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,\n\nAnd I will sing to Your name.”\n\n)?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Read Hebrews 10:22-25\nHebrews 10:22-25\n\n22let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.\n\n, Hebrews 11\nHebrews 11\n\nThe Triumphs of Faith\n\n1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.\n\n3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.\n\n8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.\n\n13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.\n\n17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.\n\n23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.\n\n30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.\n\n32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.\n\n39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.\n\n, and Hebrews 12:1-3\nHebrews 12:1-3\n\nJesus, the Example\n\n1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.\n\n. After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

He claimed to bring the ultimate\nrest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time - on Good Friday, and he\nrose again on the following Sunday... which is the first day of the next week\n<em>or</em> the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate\nsabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"#questions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"questions\"></a>Questions</h1>\n<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>How does the author of Genesis conclude each of the seven days of creation?\nConsider the seventh day of creation as an ultimate rest day. What do you\nthink it would be like to always live in that rest with God?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! Scripture &quot;Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.\n\n8God called the expanse heaven.

And there was\nevening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\nThe Creation of Man and Woman\n\n1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By\nthe seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on\nthe seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the\nseventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work\nwhich God had created and made.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at\nthings I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order in my\nhobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive but\nnot toilsome.</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What were the humans tempted to believe\nabout God and themselves? How did they act on these beliefs, and how did\nthis choice exile them from the place of rest? How do you think lies about\nGod and ourselves prevent us from resting with God today?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Genesis 3:1-7,21-24&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The Fall of Man\n\n1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\nGod had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall\nnot eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2The woman said to the serpent,\n“From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\nof the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall\nnot eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 4The serpent said to the\nwoman, “You surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\nfrom it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil.” 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\nwise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\nwith her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\nknew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made\nthemselves loin coverings. \n\n21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\nand his wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man\nhas become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch\nout his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live\nforever”— 23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to\ncultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;\nand at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the\nflaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of\nlife.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Humans are templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information\nthey are templted to <em>be like God</em>. They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>\n<p>They acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they\nchose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>\n<p>It seems like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh. Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am\nsimply less tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good\nand bad</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>God wants to restore humanity to ultimate rest, so he chooses the\nIsraelites to reenact his seventh-day rest so they can share it with\nothers.

But in respect to your\ncountrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one\nanother.\n\nOf Redeeming a Poor Man\n\n47‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes\nsufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as\nto sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\ndescendants of a stranger’s family, 48then he shall have redemption right\nafter he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\nor his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his\nfamily may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\nwith his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to\nhim up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond\nto the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be\nwith him. 51If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his\npurchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 52and if few\nyears remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In\nproportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.\n53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule\nover him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed by these\nmeans, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with\nhim. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I\nbrought out from the land of Egypt.
