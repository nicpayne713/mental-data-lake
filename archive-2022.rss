<p>Playing around with Modal Labs</p>
<p>One of the first things I tried was a regular cron job...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@stub.function(
    schedule=modal.Period(minutes=59), secret=modal.Secret.from_name(&quot;my-dummy-secret&quot;)
)
def say_hi():
    now = time.ctime()
    secret = os.environ.get(&quot;dummy-secret&quot;)
    print(f&quot;Hello {os.environ.get('USER', 'Rodney')} at {now}&quot;)
    print(f&quot;{secret=}&quot;)

</code></pre>
<p>This can get deployed with <code>modal deploy --name &lt;app name&gt; &lt;path to .py file with the stub and function defined in it&gt; </code></p>
<p>This function gets deployed as an app that I conveniently call <code>say_hi</code> (as far
as I can tell the app name can be anything - as I add functions to this same
app and deploy with the same name to get a new version)</p>
<p>Notice that this also is an example of giving access to a secret - defined in the Modal Labs dashboard</p>
<p>We can take a look at the apps running at <a href="https://modal.com/apps">https://modal.com/apps</a></p>
<p>I then added another function to experiment with custom container images and
saw then that Modal will just slap a new version on anything provisioned with
the same name (intuitive enough for sure) so when I add functions to my .py
script and run <code>modal deploy --name say_hi myscript.py</code> over and over, the app
called <code>say_hi</code> in the Modal apps dashboard just gets a new version</p>
<p>This means I can spin up several instances of functionally the same app but with different names/versions etc...
Q: Maybe there's gitops or policy stuff builtin to app names then?</p>
<p>I needed to take down an app I deployed as a duplicate but you don't stop apps
by name, you stop them by an id... see below</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note this will run that script... so be ready for syncoid to do its thing</p>

<p>in /lib/systemd/system/docker.service there is an ExecStart command that got placed there when I setup Docker with Ansible - it threw the -H flag which told the daemon what hosts to setup. But I added the &quot;hosts&quot; key in my daemon.json and it broke - so removing the -H flag from the systemd unit fixed it</p>

<p>AJAX wasn't cutting it, traditional crontab in containers doesn't make much
sense to me, webcron is recommended but I don't want to register with anything
outside my LAN... Turns out you can just spin up an identical container with a
different entrypoint to /cron.sh that does what you need!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this is a task in an Ansible playbook - but the docker-compose is straight forward</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the only thing you need to make sure of is that <em>all</em> the configuration
options - data volumes, user permissions, etc. are <em>identical</em> between the
containers running the cron job and the one actually hosting NextCloud. This
ensures that the container running cron has proper access to the database and
filesystem - or at least the same access as NextCloud proper.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">- name: Nextcloud Cron Docker Container
  docker_container:
    name: nextcloud-cron
    image: &quot;{{ nextcloud_image }}&quot;
    pull: true

      - nextcloud-mysql:mysql
    entrypoint: /cron.sh
    volumes:
      - &quot;{{ nextcloud_data_directory }}/nextcloud:/var/www/html:rw&quot;

<p>Switching to Vim opened a whole new world to me for interacting with a computer
and for getting things done. Before I adopted Vim I used GUIs for everything
because I thought that's how it had to be done... Notes in OneNote, code using
a GUI editor, different notes in TiddlyWiki, slides for work in PowerPoint,
slides for church using Logos, etc... Adopting Vim allowed me to disconnect a
specific tool from the problem that tool is solving - because usually I just
need to write text (notes, code, slides, etc.). Now, very nearly everything I
do is from a text-based and git-based workflow... I put all my notes on
basically anything just in my blog, which is all markdown and deployed to GH
with Markata on every push (living dangerously pushing to main) - and that's
all done easily from Vim with nice syntax highlighting, fast response,
integrated git-plugins, etc.. I keep project-specific task lists just in
markdown files and I have Vim/tmux shortcuts to quickly add todos for any
project (todo list is done with markata todoui) and I can get there fast
because my Vim workflow dovetails with Tmux nicely. Also I can pull that list
up right from the terminal, which I'm already in because Vim.... Vim also
pushed me into the cli more - because Vim is so easily extended with cli tools
and I'm already in the terminal... The builtin functionality also made things
make more sense - no more right-click, find &quot;refactor all&quot; or &quot;rename symbol&quot;
(for some stupid reason)... Vim find-replace is so intuitive and if I need it
extended then I learned what sed was because of Vim. Moving quickly in Vim also
enables me to do my job incredibly fast because I hop into several projects a
day in a coaching role - if I was bound by GUIs I'd be waiting forever for
startup, would lose which GUI instance was which project, etc... Being in the
terminal also made Tmux a trivial choice - now I have 90 tmux sessions, all
named appropriately, ready for me to jump back to and all while keeping the
majority of RAM still free for Chrome. Vim as my IDE also forced me to learn
way more about Python (I'm a python developer primarily), how LSP works, how to
configure a development environment, etc... things I took for granted in my GUI
workflows, or never knew, or worse - thought I knew but deeply misunderstood.
Now that I understand them better, I can coach my peers more effectively even
if they are still in a GUI-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>Basically, (Neo)Vim actually did change my life and I'm really thankful for it
(maybe that should be the title?)</p>

    * Stories get isolated and distilled down into a simple moral model, where the hero is just the hero.
    * Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense
    * There's something correct about this - but the oversimplification usually comes out of a massive re-writting of the stories, then anyone raised on those versions of the story is scaldalized when they read it for real

2. Poltical-authority source
    * Political parties hijacking &quot;The Bible says X about Y&quot; as a means to harvest authority from a book that many people claim is authoritative.

3. Theology answer book model
    * Treating the Bible like a dictionary of key/value pairs where keys are questions and values are simple answers.
    * This ignores narrative, and general literacy.
    * The instinct may be right - the Bible should profoundly shape my view of everything, but it isn't simple

<p>A result of asking the wrong questions is the common story of people's faith being dismantled <em>by reading the Bible</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible&quot;</p>
<pre><code>One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
side the New Testament? —

redemption. He's recognized by them once their eyes are opened then he vanishes

<p><code>Old Testament</code> is the Christian term for a set of writings that comprise about
3/4 of the Christian Bible. The authors themselves though refer to those
writings as <code>the Scriptures</code>. One time it is called <code>the Old Covenant</code> by Paul
, but he's talking about Synagogue readings of the Torah portion in synagogues.
THe phrase <code>Hebrew Bible</code> is a modern term that is a bit more neutral.</p>

<pre><code>25 And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary
that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”

all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

<pre><code>49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood
of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged
against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell
you, it will be required of this generation.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Jesus pick these two events? Abel is murdered on page 4, Zechariah is
murdered in the last part of Chronicles, which in the TaNaK is significant...
Jesus is saying that <em>all the prophets from the beginning of the Scriptures to
the end</em>... All the prophets from A-Z so to speak</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Scriptures&quot;</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Books&quot; as we know it, bound papers with writing on it, called a 'codex'
wasn't a thing until a couple hundred years post-Jesus... so when the
authors say &quot;The Scriptures&quot; we need to keep in mind that Jews had the
scriptures in their minds and hearts, not on paper (save for a couple very
expensive scrolls). So the structure of the scriptures is also apart of the
Jewish being... This interaction with the Scriptures is _very very very
different than how we interact with the Bible_

<p>Around 100-200 AD there was a split in the Jewish community over things like
how the Temple and sacrifices were to be run, etc. A group got kicked out, so
they grabbed some scrolls and went to start what we'd think of as a Monastic
community. Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group
managed are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own
writings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.</p>
<p>The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran. They were
found in the 1940s by a bunch of shepherds. A few showed up online for sale and
that's how we found out about their exitence.... These scrolls give us
pre-Christian Jewish Bible nerds...</p>
<p>Qumran community didn't know about Jesus - they thought the Messiah would be a
man called <em>The Teacher of Righteousness</em></p>
<h3><a href="#scroll-making" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="scroll-making"></a>Scroll-making</h3>
<p>The DSS preserved for us, not only ancient biblical texts, but also the method
by which scrolls were created. They were well-preserved papyrus that was
stiched together - literal stitches. We also have obvious additions from Qumran
community as well as notes from priests and corrections from missed
transcribing.</p>
<h3><a href="#our-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="our-bible"></a>Our Bible</h3>
<p>The DSS scrolls, being the oldest stitched together set of scrolls, teach us
how scrolls and collections of ancient holy texts were put together. We need to
keep this in mind when we think about where our Christian Bible came from</p>
<p>The beginning and ending of our books might/are filled with hyperlinks that
call a reader's mind back to other stories. It's the way of linking context and
stories to one another before the writings are in a codex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hyperlinks - language/syntax that remind a reader of antoher scroll - help us
understand the structure of the Hebrew Bible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! note &quot;A favorite quote from Tim&quot;</p>
<pre><code>So, you can see I'm interested in a historical question of like the
collection [Hebrew Bible] was produced by a group of people. What did they
mean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate
them and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what
they're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you
that—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all
points to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the
apostles talk about these texts.
So that's different from saying nobody
knew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go
reread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It
seems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting
and complicated than that.  [17:30-18:21]

<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Hebrew word “emet” is translated with words like “faithful,”
“reliable,” “sure,” “trustworthy,” and “amen.” Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,
Psalm 19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are
communicating in these passages when they use the word “emet.”
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 36:5-6&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,

Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

6Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;

Your judgments are like a great deep.

O Lord, You preserve man and beast.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 19:7&quot;</p>
<pre><code>7The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;

The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 41:13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,

From everlasting to everlasting.

Amen and Amen.
</code></pre>
<p>I think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His
faithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a
kid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,
and my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my
children - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or
worldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -
he sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand
faithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my
faithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that
<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that
would rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom
collapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the
beginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What
do you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?

1I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;

To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.

In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”

3“I have made a covenant with My chosen;

Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,

7A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,

And awesome above all those who are around Him?

Hebrews 11

The Triumphs of Faith

1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.

3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.

13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.

17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.

23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.

30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.

32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

, and Hebrews 12:1-3
Hebrews 12:1-3

Jesus, the Example

1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

. After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.
