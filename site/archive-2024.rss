<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible
is no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby
he'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood
by abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a
&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything
like that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of
imagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images
of the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise
man who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds
his house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>
<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or
folly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for
humanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole
earth.</p>
<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it
more fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in
a way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater
humanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look
around if you doubt this truth).</p>
<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on
the rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets
hard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and
I've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those
things bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of
Paul in Romans 8...</p>
<pre><code class="language-Romans">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present
trials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```

By God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the
Love God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver
bullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know
the sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.

<pre><code>24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

<h2><a href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="reflection"></a>Reflection</h2>
<p>From the visual commentary Tim calls out a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>the rock</code> is supposed to first call us back to earlier in the sermon when Jesus calls his people &quot;the light of the world&quot; and says &quot;a city on a hill [mountain] cannot be hidden&quot; (Matthew 5:14). The hill [ὄρος | oros] means &quot;mountain&quot; and is a hyperlink to OT teaching of God's people living in the ideal Jerusalem on Mt. Zion. Lots of Hebrew imagery here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rain and floods are a callback to the Chaos Waters of the OT (and general ANE thinking). It's a reference to the destructive nature that we humans have unleashed on the world - but the wise man who listens to Jesus lives a life with some amount of protection from those hardships - and ultimate protection from God handing us over to Chaos (destruction).</p>
</li>

<p>I know there's a lot more to where the texts come from and the varying
traditions in Judaism. But I think at a very high level, Jesus is saying that
we all know, deep down, how to live in harmony but that it requires sacrifice.
He calls us to live sacrificially <em>towards each other</em>, to live in Heaven
today, so we can experience the coming reality if our own resurrection</p>

<p>I woke up to faulty internet and after some troubleshooting it turns out the
root zfs dataset that OPNSense boots from got corrupted...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PRO-TIP - Auto backup your OPNSense config to Google Drive, git, or
nextcloud... But if you won't then at least back up your OPNSense config
somewhere everytime you update it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's too much to recount every issue, so here's a bullet list what worked.</p>
<ol>
<li>On a fresh drive install OPNSense</li>
<li>Plug in the old drive through a USB enclosure - now I'm not sure what would
happen if you plugged it in along with the new drive and then booted up.
Because both drives will have a zfs pool <code>zroot</code> and the boot dataset is
automounted at <code>/zroot/ROOT/default</code>. My old <code>zroot</code> pool was <code>SUSPENDED</code> so it
didn't automount</li>
<li>Because the old <code>zoot/ROOT/default</code> was corrupted I did this to mount it RO:
<code>zpool import -d &lt;path to zfs partition - /dev/stuff&gt; -N zroot zrootrecovery</code></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>-d is the zfs flag to import the pool by disk id, -N it to not mount any of
the datasets (we need to change mountpoints) and the <code>zroot zrootrecovery</code>
imports the <code>zroot</code> pool with a new name</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Change the mountpoints for all the <code>zrootrecovery</code> datasets to somewhere
like <code>/mnt/zrootrecovery</code></li>
<li>Depending on the mount point you set you'll find a <code>config</code> directory around
<code>/mnt/zrootrecovery/ROOT/default/config</code> - copy the file you want to another
machine via scp or whatever</li>
<li>Go to OPNSense webui and recover from that config!</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all this process took me around 8 hours but I did run into about ever
issue under the sun (several bad disks in the mix, a laptop that wouldn't live
boot into a BSD system, etc.)</p>

Hypocrite! First take out the beam from your eye, and then you can see clearly

<p>James builds on this with <code>if any of you lacks wisdom then ask for wisdom it will be given to you</code>. James is arming us with some specifics from the Sermon
on the Mount. We aren't just to ask for anything that we think is good...
wisdom is the good we are to ask for.</p>
<p>Tim: Prayer is important because wisdom will flow out of a deep interpersonal
relationship with God.</p>

<li>He's given me a lot of professional wisdom - potentially through AuDHD and the exposure he's brought me through.</li>
<li>Through Mark Forstrom, Andrew, Nick Z, etc. I was filled with wisdom on how to be a man in the life of a boy - how to talk with someone immature, let them be and feel heard, but also on how to challenge them to grow (up).</li>

<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video. The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are unobtrusive.</p>
<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>
<pre><code>Do not judge so tha tyou will not be judged. Because with the judgement that you judge, you will be judged.

And with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you.
</code></pre>
<p>There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an AuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying he'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew 7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - <code>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</code> is how my Souther Baptist Grandma used to say it.</p>
<p>I've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally what I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty unreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do you take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own eye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely don't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a position of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my family is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people living their lives.</p>
<p>The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is directionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a kid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly driven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt responsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of God's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my time thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will save who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage - my own life and family.</p>

<p>I was using a fun LaTex-based project for managing my resume called <a href="https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV">AltaCV</a>. I loved the customization and was familiar with Tek from school. However, I update my resume so infrequently that anytime I'd hop back to it I'd have to remember how to work with Tex and that was frustrating as I've lost touch with it over the years.</p>
<p>Scrolling GitHub treding repos I saw <a href="https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv">RenderCV</a> which let's me just use YAML to write my resume and then it compiles to Tek through Python. There's a sister project to make your own using this very easly call <a href="https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv-pipeline">rendercv-pipeline</a>. I forked that repo and translated my tek resume to the YAML. The included theme is nice enough is YAML is much easier to maintain long-term.</p>
<p>My resume is behind a private GH repo but the example from rendercv-pipeline is <a href="https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv-pipeline/blob/main/John_Doe_CV.pdf">here on GitHub</a></p>
