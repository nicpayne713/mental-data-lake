<h2><a href="#eda" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="eda"></a>EDA</h2>
<p>I work with data a lot, but the nature of my job isn't to dive super deep into a small amount of datasets,
I'm often jumping between several projects every day and need to just get a super quick glance at some tables to get a high level view.</p>
<p>When I'm doing more interactive exploration I've graduated from Jupyter cells with <code>df_N.head()</code> to using an amazing tool called <a href="https://www.visidata.org/">visidata</a></p>
<p>However, Visidata is a terminal based application and I'm often in an iPython console... so is there a way to move even faster for my super quick summary views?</p>
<p><u>yes!</u></p>
<h2><a href="#skimpy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="skimpy"></a>Skimpy</h2>
<p>First thing to do is <code>pip install skimpy</code> and then it's as easy to get some summary stats with <code>skimpy &lt;data&gt;</code></p>

<p>This is super nice for seeing missing values in particular as well as the distribution shape of the data.</p>
<h2><a href="#ipython" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="ipython"></a>iPython</h2>
<p>But wait... I just said I'm normally in an iPython session but that was called from zsh.. If I'm hoping back into zsh I might as well use visidata to have more powerful exploration at my fingertips.
So... can I see this table quickly without breaking my iPython workflow?</p>
<p><u>Of course you can with magic!</u></p>

<p>The above assumes you're looking at a file, like you would in the terminal.
<code>skimpy</code> works even better in iPython with <code>from skimpy import skim</code> then pass any DataFrame to <code>skim</code>!</p>

<h2><a href="#vpn" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="vpn"></a>VPN</h2>
<p>Virtual Private Networks are a big deal, and this shouldn't be considered anything even close to a guide on using them.
Here are just my notes and some setup for how I use <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a> at home.</p>
<h2><a href="#wireguard" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="wireguard"></a>Wireguard</h2>
<p>Wireguard is an awesome peer-to-peer VPN tunnel that makes it really easy for me to get into my home network when I'm out and about.
My main reasons for this are 1. I don't trust public wi-fi and 2. I want to use pi-hole for ad blocking when I'm not at home</p>
<p>Wireguard can be configured as a &quot;peer-to-site&quot; VPN tunnel as well.
My vpn setup let's me jump to various machines on my network from anywhere!</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pivpn.io/">pivpn</a> in a VM that's already running <code>pi-hole</code> to host my wireguard server.
It's super easy to setup just by following the instructions on the pivpn site.</p>
<p>The reason I like it is that I have a nice <code>cli</code> for managing wireguard configs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dumbledore@pihole-vpn:~$ pivpn
::: Control all PiVPN specific functions!
:::
::: Usage: pivpn &lt;command&gt; [option]
:::
::: Commands:
:::    -a, add              Create a client conf profile
:::    -c, clients          List any connected clients to the server
:::    -d, debug            Start a debugging session if having trouble
:::    -l, list             List all clients
:::   -qr, qrcode           Show the qrcode of a client for use with the mobile app
:::    -r, remove           Remove a client
:::  -off, off              Disable a user
:::   -on, on               Enable a user
:::    -h, help             Show this help dialog
:::    -u, uninstall        Uninstall pivpn from your system!
:::   -up, update           Updates PiVPN Scripts
:::   -bk, backup           Backup VPN configs and user profiles
</code></pre>
<p>When I'm ready to add a new client to my <code>wg</code> network, it's as easy as <code>pivpn add</code> and follow the instructions.
The easiest part here is that you'll be given a QR code in the terminal that you can just scan with the client (like a smart phone) and you'll have your wireguard config handled by the app (oh right, download the wireguard app) in no time!</p>
