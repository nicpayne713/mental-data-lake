      "title": "How To Survive The Flood",
      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible\nis no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby\nhe'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood\nby abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a\n&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything\nlike that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of\nimagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images\nof the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise\nman who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds\nhis house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or\nfolly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for\nhumanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole\nearth.</p>\n<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it\nmore fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in\na way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater\nhumanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look\naround if you doubt this truth).</p>\n<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on\nthe rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets\nhard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and\nI've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those\nthings bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of\nPaul in Romans 8...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Romans\">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present\ntrials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```\n\nBy God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the\nLove God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver\nbullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know\nthe sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.\n\n&lt;!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer --&gt;\n\n[github]: https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite\n</code></pre>\n",

      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video. The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are unobtrusive.</p>\n<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>\n<pre><code>Do not judge so tha tyou will not be judged. Because with the judgement that you judge, you will be judged.\n\nAnd with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you.\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an AuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying he'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew 7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - <code>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</code> is how my Souther Baptist Grandma used to say it.</p>\n<p>I've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally what I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty unreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do you take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own eye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely don't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a position of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my family is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people living their lives.</p>\n<p>The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is directionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a kid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly driven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt responsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of God's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my time thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will save who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage - my own life and family.</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

By his good conduct let him\nshow his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy\nand selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.\n15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,\nunspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there\nwill be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first\npure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,\nimpartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by\nthose who make peace.\n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Jas 3:13–18).

He should pray. Is anyone\ncheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should\nsummon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing\nhim with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will\nsave the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has\ncommitted sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one\nanother, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective\nprayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being\nwith the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,\nand it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he\nprayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.\n19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and\nsomeone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner\nback from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and\nwill cover over a great number of sins.\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"#when-to-pray\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"when-to-pray\"></a>When to pray</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>All circumstances of life</li>\n<li>Sickness</li>\n<li>Confession</li>\n<li>Working out the will of God</li>\n<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>\n<p>For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.</p>\n<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong> look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>\n<p>I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#jc-ryles-quote\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"jc-ryles-quote\"></a>JC Ryle's quote</h3>\n<p>I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.</p>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 1:6&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>From the sole of the foot and up to the head\nthere is no health in it;\nbruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,\nand they have not been bound up\nand not softened with the oil.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalm 23:5&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5 You prepare before me a table\nin the presence of my oppressors.\nYou anoint my head with oil;\nmy cup is overflowing.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;1 Kings 17:1-16&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh\nlives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be\ndew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh\ncame to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must\nhide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be\nthat you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to\nsustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.\nHe went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows\nwere bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in\nthe evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that\nthe wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\n\n8 Then the\nword of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which\nbelongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a\nwidow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to\nthe gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called\nto her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so\nthat I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,\n“Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh\nyour God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋\nin the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few\npieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we\nmight eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do\naccording to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,\nand bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.\n14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be\nemptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh\ngives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according\nto the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many\ndays. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not\nrun out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of\nElijah.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group\nmanaged are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>\n<p>Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own\nwritings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.</p>\n<p>The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran.

What did they\nmean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate\nthem and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what\nthey're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you\nthat—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all\npoints to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the\napostles talk about these texts.\nSo that's different from saying nobody\nknew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go\nreread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It\nseems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting\nand complicated than that.

His\nfaithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a\nkid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,\nand my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my\nchildren - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or\nworldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that\n<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\nwould rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom\ncollapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\nbeginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\ndo you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Samuel 7:16&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;PSALM 89&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The Lord’s Covenant with David, and Israel’s Afflictions.\n\nA Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.\n\n1I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;\n\nTo all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.\n\n2For I have said, “Lovingkindness will be built up forever;\n\nIn the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”\n\n3“I have made a covenant with My chosen;\n\nI have sworn to David My servant,\n\n4I will establish your seed forever\n\nAnd build up your throne to all generations.” Selah.\n\n5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;\n\nYour faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.\n\n6For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord?\n\nWho among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,\n\n7A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,\n\nAnd awesome above all those who are around Him?\n\n8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord?\n\nYour faithfulness also surrounds You.\n\n9You rule the swelling of the sea;\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Ultimately, God answers the psalmist’s cries in the person of Jesus. Compare 2 Samuel 7:16\n2 Samuel 7:16\n\n16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”\n\nto Hebrews 1:8-9\nHebrews 1:8-9\n\n8But of the Son He says,\n\n“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,\n\nAnd the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.\n\n9You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;\n\nTherefore God, Your God, has anointed You\n\nWith the oil of gladness above Your companions.”\n\n. How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John 1:14\nJohn 1:14\n\nThe Word Made Flesh\n\n14And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\n, Hebrews 3:5-6\nHebrews 3:5-6\n\n5Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.\n\n, and Romans 15:8-9\nRomans 15:8-9\n\n8For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written,\n\n“Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,\n\nAnd I will sing to Your name.”\n\n)?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Read Hebrews 10:22-25\nHebrews 10:22-25\n\n22let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.\n\n, Hebrews 11\nHebrews 11\n\nThe Triumphs of Faith\n\n1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.\n\n3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.\n\n8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.\n\n13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.\n\n17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.\n\n23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.\n\n30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.\n\n32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.\n\n39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.\n\n, and Hebrews 12:1-3\nHebrews 12:1-3\n\nJesus, the Example\n\n1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.\n\n. After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

He claimed to bring the ultimate\nrest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time - on Good Friday, and he\nrose again on the following Sunday... which is the first day of the next week\n<em>or</em> the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate\nsabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.</p>\n<h1><a href=\"#questions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"questions\"></a>Questions</h1>\n<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>How does the author of Genesis conclude each of the seven days of creation?\nConsider the seventh day of creation as an ultimate rest day. What do you\nthink it would be like to always live in that rest with God?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! Scripture &quot;Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.\n\n8God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was\nmorning, a second day.\n\n13There was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n\n19There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n\n23There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n\n31God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was\nevening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\nThe Creation of Man and Woman\n\n1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By\nthe seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on\nthe seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the\nseventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work\nwhich God had created and made.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at\nthings I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order in my\nhobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive but\nnot toilsome.</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What were the humans tempted to believe\nabout God and themselves? How did they act on these beliefs, and how did\nthis choice exile them from the place of rest? How do you think lies about\nGod and ourselves prevent us from resting with God today?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Genesis 3:1-7,21-24&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The Fall of Man\n\n1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\nGod had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall\nnot eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2The woman said to the serpent,\n“From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\nof the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall\nnot eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 4The serpent said to the\nwoman, “You surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\nfrom it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil.” 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\nwise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\nwith her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\nknew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made\nthemselves loin coverings. \n\n21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\nand his wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man\nhas become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch\nout his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live\nforever”— 23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to\ncultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;\nand at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the\nflaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of\nlife.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Humans are templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information\nthey are templted to <em>be like God</em>. They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>\n<p>They acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they\nchose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>\n<p>It seems like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh. Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am\nsimply less tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good\nand bad</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>God wants to restore humanity to ultimate rest, so he chooses the\nIsraelites to reenact his seventh-day rest so they can share it with\nothers. Of all the ways he invites them to practice rest which practice are\nyou least familiar with today?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Exodus 20:8-11&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>8“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9Six days you shall labor and\ndo all your work, 10but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;\nin it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your\nmale or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with\nyou. 11For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and\nall that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord\nblessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Leviticus 23:1-3; 25:8-13&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Laws of Religious Festivals\n\n1The Lord spoke again to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the sons of Israel and\nsay to them, ‘The Lord’s appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy\nconvocations—My appointed times are these:\n\n3‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath\nof complete rest, a holy convocation.

You shall eat its crops out of the field.\n\n13‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.\n14If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend’s\nhand, you shall not wrong one another. 15Corresponding to the number of\nyears after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to\nyou according to the number of years of crops. 16In proportion to the\nextent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the\nfewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of\ncrops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another, but you\nshall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.\n\n18‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry\nthem out, that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will\nyield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.\n20But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do\nnot sow or gather in our crops?” 21then I will so order My blessing for you\nin the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years. 22When\nyou are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop,\neating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.\n\nThe Law of Redemption\n\n23‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;\nfor you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of\nyour property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.\n\n25‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of\nhis property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his\nrelative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his\nmeans as to find sufficient for its redemption, 27then he shall calculate\nthe years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold\nit, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not found sufficient\nmeans to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the\nhands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it\nshall revert, that he may return to his property.\n\n29‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\nredemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right\nof redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him\nwithin the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city\npasses permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not\nrevert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no\nsurrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption\nrights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the\nLevites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities\nwhich are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\nbe redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the\njubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession\namong the sons of Israel. 34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be\nsold, for that is their perpetual possession.\n\nOf Poor Countrymen\n\n35‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard\nto you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\nthat he may live with you. 36Do not take usurious interest from him, but\nrevere your God, that your countryman may live with you. 37You shall not\ngive him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. 38I am the Lord\nyour God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of\nCanaan and to be your God.\n\n39‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he\nsells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. 40He\nshall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve\nwith you until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and\nhis sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to\nthe property of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants whom I brought\nout from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You\nshall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. 44As for\nyour male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and\nfemale slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it\nis out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you\nmay gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they\nwill have produced in your land; they also may become your possession.\n46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a\npossession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your\ncountrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one\nanother.\n\nOf Redeeming a Poor Man\n\n47‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes\nsufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as\nto sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\ndescendants of a stranger’s family, 48then he shall have redemption right\nafter he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\nor his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his\nfamily may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\nwith his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to\nhim up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond\nto the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be\nwith him. 51If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his\npurchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 52and if few\nyears remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In\nproportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.\n53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule\nover him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed by these\nmeans, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with\nhim. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I\nbrought out from the land of Egypt.

As a result, they get exiled\nfrom their land and dominated by foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah\nknew that sorrow would not have the final word with these people. He looked\nforward to the day when Yahweh would end pain and corruption to lead them\ninto endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and Isaiah 51:11 . What does\nIsaiah tell us about God’s character in these passages? What does Isaiah\nsay will happen to God’s people?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 49:13&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>13Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!\n\nBreak forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!\n\nFor the Lord has comforted His people\n\nAnd will have compassion on His afflicted.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 51:11&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>11So the ransomed of the Lord will return\n\nAnd come with joyful shouting to Zion,\n\nAnd everlasting joy will be on their heads.\n\nThey will obtain gladness and joy,\n\nAnd sorrow and sighing will flee away.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Isiah tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past\nfaithfulness - <code>For the Lord _has_ comforted His people</code> as well as future\nfaithfulness - <code>So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...</code></p>\n<p>Isiah leans in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's <code>hesed</code>, his\n<strong>steadfase love</strong>, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than\nany powerful but fickle diety.</p>\n<p>Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages, promise or claim a promise of any\nkind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing in reflecting on\nGod's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's deliverance.\nGod's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of their bondage.</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel’s redeemer. His\nprophecies were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why\nwere the shepherds afraid?

All\nthroughout the OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,\nspecifically on Sinai. Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown\nYahweh's back due to his glory, and then Moses has to veil his face so that the\nglory of the Lord persisted on him would not terrify the Israelites.</p>\n<p>The angels outright said that a Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.\nThere is no greater cause for joy than the king of creation returning</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\nand his promises.

How is this good news for everyone?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Hebrews 7&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s\n\n1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.\n\n4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.\n\n11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,\n\n“You are a priest forever\n\nAccording to the order of Melchizedek.”\n\n18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,\n\n“The Lord has sworn\n\nAnd will not change His mind,\n\n‘You are a priest forever’ ”);\n\n22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.\n\n23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.\n\n26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Melchizedek was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>\n<li>Melchizedek was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>\n<li>Levitical priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>\n<li>Former priests, Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably died)</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

The\ntop (center) is the Tree of Life, which represents God's life and creative\npower. Humans <strong>were supposed to eat from the Tree of Life</strong> but there's\nanother tree, the Tree of Knowledge of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; which represents\nassuming the authority to define good and bad for one's own life rather than\ntrusting God's defintion. Human eat of that tree and are thus exiled from the\ngarden.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#burning-bush\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"burning-bush\"></a>Burning Bush</h2>\n<p>Moses meets God at a burning tree, a plant on a mountain radiating with God's\npower just like the Tree of Life. Yahweh charges Moses to bring the same choice\nto the Israelites that Adam and Eve had, which is to trust God or define\nmorality for themselves.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#jesus\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"jesus\"></a>Jesus</h2>\n<p>Jesus announced that God's eternal life is available through him now -\noriginally in Eden given through the Tree of Life. Jesus invites other people\nto &quot;eat of him&quot; to be transformed by God's own life. The invitation is the same</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to trust Yahweh or not. But Jesus' life exposes humanity's brokenness in that\nhumans crucified him. Jesus is hung on a cross (a tree) on the top of a\nhill (like Mt. Sinai) and humans not only eat of a different false tree of\nlife, but they chopped down the real Tree of Life - Jesus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a href=\"#questions\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"questions\"></a>Questions</h1>\n<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>    What is one practical example of what it means to eat from the tree of\n    life? How is it different from eating from the false tree of life?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Giving money away I think is one practical example of eating from the tree of\nlife. Jesus calls us to share our blessings, and choosing to live by his\nauthority rather than decide for myself what to do with my money (meaning to\nspend it on my desires only rather than invest in the Kingdom) then I make the\nsame choice humanity always makes - to not trust God's definition of good and\nbad</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Compare John 15:5-13\nwith Matthew 7:15-20\n. How does the true vine give life? How do we recognize a false tree of life?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;John 15:5-13&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he\nbears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If anyone does not\nabide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather\nthem, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you abide in Me,\nand My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for\nyou. 8My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so\nprove to be My disciples. 9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also\nloved you; abide in My love. 10If you keep My commandments, you will abide\nin My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His\nlove. 11These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and\nthat your joy may be made full. Disciples’ Relation to Each Other 12“This\nis My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.\n13Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his\nfriends.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Matthew 7:15-20&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>15“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but\ninwardly are ravenous wolves. 16You will know them by their fruits. Grapes\nare not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? 17So\nevery good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18A\ngood tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.\n19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the\nfire. 20So then, you will know them by their fruits.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The true vine gives life through communion and connection. Jesus says to &quot;abide\nin [him]&quot; which is represented by a choice to believe him about kingdom, love,\nrelationships, brokenness, etc... By meditating on the Word of God, communing\nwith Jesus, being washed and guided by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into\nthe image of Jesus which is real and true life.</p>\n<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>What are some examples of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Galations 5:16-25&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>16But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of\nthe flesh. 17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the\nSpirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so\nthat you may not do the things that you please. 18But if you are led by the\nSpirit, you are not under the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are\nevident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,\nenmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,\nfactions, 21envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of\nwhich I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who\npractice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit\nof the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,\nfaithfulness, 23gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no\nlaw. 24Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with\nits passions and desires. 25If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by\nthe Spirit.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Good fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>- choosing to guard my eyes and thoughts against sexual immorality\n- remaining calm when things aren't going my way at work\n- drinking water instead of _another_ drink at night\n- giving money away out of love\n- seeking unity and charity especially in any time of conflict\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bad fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>- outbursts at work - for me this is basically giving up hope for someone to be successful. By God's grace I have a desire to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust that desire and instead of prioritize an individual's well-being/growth I place my frustration above that and let my annoyance guide me more than a spirit of teaching and gentleness\n- having that second, or third, drink \n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are led byt he Spirit, you are not under the Law... This isn't saying\nthat the Law doesn't apply, but that by the Spirit's guidance we will never\nbe found guilty by anything in the Law!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>When Jesus talks about what his death will accomplish, he talks about a\nseed going into the ground before it bears fruit (see John 12:23-26). What\ncould it look like to live in the ways of Jesus and bear the fruit of life?\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;John 12:23-26&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>23And Jesus *answered them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man\nto be glorified. 24Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat\nfalls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears\nmuch fruit. 25He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in\nthis world will keep it to life eternal. 26If anyone serves Me, he must\nfollow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves\nMe, the Father will honor him.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Meditating on God's faithfulness to humanity in spite of our disobedience I\nthink is an avenue by which the Spirit changes our hearts and as we are changed\nby him we live lives that reflect Jesus' own life</p>\n<p>I think there can be many facets to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece\nseems fairly self-evident in the passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a\nseed that never dies) then we will never flourish, but if we give up the life\nwe have now and live like Jesus did, we will blessed with life</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
