      "title": "How To Survive The Flood",
      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible\nis no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby\nhe'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood\nby abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a\n&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything\nlike that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of\nimagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images\nof the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise\nman who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds\nhis house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or\nfolly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for\nhumanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole\nearth.</p>\n<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it\nmore fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in\na way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater\nhumanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look\naround if you doubt this truth).</p>\n<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on\nthe rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets\nhard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and\nI've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those\nthings bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of\nPaul in Romans 8...</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Romans\">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present\ntrials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```\n\nBy God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the\nLove God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver\nbullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know\nthe sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.\n\n&lt;!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer --&gt;\n\n[github]: https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite\n</code></pre>\n",

      "content_html": "<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown header -->\n<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video. The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are unobtrusive.</p>\n<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>\n<pre><code>Do not judge so tha tyou will not be judged. Because with the judgement that you judge, you will be judged.\n\nAnd with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you.\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an AuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying he'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew 7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - <code>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</code> is how my Souther Baptist Grandma used to say it.</p>\n<p>I've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally what I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty unreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do you take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own eye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely don't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a position of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my family is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people living their lives.</p>\n<p>The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is directionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a kid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly driven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt responsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of God's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my time thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will save who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage - my own life and family.</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

I loved the customization and was familiar with Tek from school. However, I update my resume so infrequently that anytime I'd hop back to it I'd have to remember how to work with Tex and that was frustrating as I've lost touch with it over the years.</p>\n<p>Scrolling GitHub treding repos I saw <a href=\"https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv\">RenderCV</a> which let's me just use YAML to write my resume and then it compiles to Tek through Python. There's a sister project to make your own using this very easly call <a href=\"https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv-pipeline\">rendercv-pipeline</a>. I forked that repo and translated my tek resume to the YAML. The included theme is nice enough is YAML is much easier to maintain long-term.</p>\n<p>My resume is behind a private GH repo but the example from rendercv-pipeline is <a href=\"https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv-pipeline/blob/main/John_Doe_CV.pdf\">here on GitHub</a></p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
