So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#july-15\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"july-15\"></a>July 15</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Missed several meetings due to unfortunate travel circumstances</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;James 3:13-18&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him\nshow his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy\nand selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.\n15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,\nunspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there\nwill be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first\npure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,\nimpartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by\nthose who make peace.\n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Jas 3:13–18).

He should pray. Is anyone\ncheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should\nsummon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing\nhim with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will\nsave the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has\ncommitted sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one\nanother, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective\nprayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being\nwith the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,\nand it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he\nprayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.\n19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and\nsomeone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner\nback from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and\nwill cover over a great number of sins.\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"#when-to-pray\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"when-to-pray\"></a>When to pray</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>All circumstances of life</li>\n<li>Sickness</li>\n<li>Confession</li>\n<li>Working out the will of God</li>\n<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>\n<p>For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.</p>\n<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong> look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>\n<p>I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#jc-ryles-quote\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"jc-ryles-quote\"></a>JC Ryle's quote</h3>\n<p>I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.</p>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 1:6&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>From the sole of the foot and up to the head\nthere is no health in it;\nbruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,\nand they have not been bound up\nand not softened with the oil.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalm 23:5&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>5 You prepare before me a table\nin the presence of my oppressors.\nYou anoint my head with oil;\nmy cup is overflowing.\n</code></pre>\n<p>!!! scripture &quot;1 Kings 17:1-16&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh\nlives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be\ndew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh\ncame to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must\nhide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be\nthat you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to\nsustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.\nHe went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows\nwere bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in\nthe evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that\nthe wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.\n\n8 Then the\nword of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which\nbelongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a\nwidow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to\nthe gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called\nto her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so\nthat I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,\n“Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh\nyour God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋\nin the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few\npieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we\nmight eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do\naccording to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,\nand bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.\n14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be\nemptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh\ngives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according\nto the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many\ndays. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not\nrun out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of\nElijah.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
