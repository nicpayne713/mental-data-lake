<h2><a href="#disclaimer" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This was written by ChatGPT with zero oversight from me. There are a few things that are not 100% accurate, but the main idea is there... I am hoping to actually write about my experience with nostr as I get more involved on the platform.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-power-of-the-decentralized-social-media-platform-nostr-a-guide-for-beginners" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-power-of-the-decentralized-social-media-platform-nostr-a-guide-for-beginners"></a>The Power of the Decentralized Social Media Platform Nostr: A Guide for Beginners</h3>
<p>Social media has become a cornerstone of modern communication, allowing individuals to connect across borders and share ideas instantly. However, traditional platforms have raised concerns about censorship, data privacy, and the monopolistic control of user-generated content. <strong>Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays)</strong>, a decentralized social media protocol, offers a revolutionary alternative by emphasizing freedom, privacy, and user autonomy. This essay explores the transformative power of Nostr, why it matters, and provides a practical guide for beginners to get started.</p>

<h3><a href="#the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-power-of-decentralization-why-nostr-matters"></a>The Power of Decentralization: Why Nostr Matters</h3>
<p>At its core, Nostr is a decentralized protocol designed to enable social media functionality without reliance on centralized servers. Unlike traditional platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, which depend on centralized infrastructure owned by corporations, Nostr operates on a peer-to-peer network facilitated by relays. This structural shift offers several key advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong><br />
Centralized platforms often act as gatekeepers of content, enforcing moderation policies that can result in censorship. Nostr, on the other hand, allows users to communicate directly without interference from centralized authorities. This makes it particularly valuable for individuals in regions with restrictive speech laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong><br />
On traditional platforms, users sacrifice ownership of their data, which is often monetized by corporations. Nostr empowers users to retain control over their content and personal information by using cryptographic keys to manage identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resilience Against Shutdowns</strong><br />
Centralized platforms are vulnerable to outages, government intervention, or corporate decisions to deplatform users. Nostr’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity can shut it down, providing a more resilient communication medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open and Transparent Ecosystem</strong><br />
As an open protocol, Nostr allows developers to create interoperable applications and services. This fosters innovation, enabling users to choose from a variety of client applications while maintaining access to the same network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><a href="#how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-nostr-works-the-technical-backbone"></a>How Nostr Works: The Technical Backbone</h3>
<p>Nostr uses a simple yet effective system to transmit messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public and Private Keys</strong>: Each user generates a pair of cryptographic keys. The private key acts as their identity, while the public key serves as their address on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Relays</strong>: These are lightweight servers that broadcast messages. Users send notes (messages) to relays, which distribute them to other users.</li>
<li><strong>Clients</strong>: Users access Nostr through client applications, which function as user interfaces. Examples include Damus (for mobile) and Amethyst.</li>
</ul>
<p>This decentralized architecture eliminates single points of failure and gives users the flexibility to connect via multiple clients.</p>

<h3><a href="#a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-nostr"></a>A Beginner’s Guide to Getting Started with Nostr</h3>
<p>For those new to Nostr, the decentralized structure might seem intimidating at first. However, with the following step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to join the network and start interacting with others seamlessly.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-1-generate-your-keys" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-1-generate-your-keys"></a>Step 1: Generate Your Keys</h4>
<p>The first step is to create a pair of cryptographic keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private Key</strong>: This is your unique identifier and must be kept secret. Treat it like a password.</li>
<li><strong>Public Key</strong>: This is your &quot;address&quot; on Nostr and can be shared with others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Nostr client applications automatically generate these keys for you upon sign-up. Ensure you securely back up your private key, as losing it means losing access to your account permanently.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-2-choose-a-nostr-client" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-2-choose-a-nostr-client"></a>Step 2: Choose a Nostr Client</h4>
<p>Clients are the gateways through which you interact with the Nostr protocol. Popular options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damus</strong> (iOS/Android): User-friendly and feature-rich.</li>
<li><strong>Amethyst</strong> (Android): Tailored for Android users with a sleek interface.</li>
<li><strong>Web Clients</strong>: Platforms like <strong>Nostr.guru</strong> or <strong>Iris</strong> allow you to access Nostr via a browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Install your chosen client and log in using your keys.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-3-connect-to-relays" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-3-connect-to-relays"></a>Step 3: Connect to Relays</h4>
<p>Relays are the backbone of the Nostr network, enabling message distribution. Most clients come pre-configured with default relays, but you can add more for better connectivity and reliability. Simply search for &quot;Nostr relay services&quot; and paste the relay URLs into your client settings.</p>
<h4><a href="#step-4-explore-and-interact" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-4-explore-and-interact"></a>Step 4: Explore and Interact</h4>
<p>Once set up, you can start exploring the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow Users</strong>: Add public keys of other users to your feed.</li>
<li><strong>Post Notes</strong>: Share your thoughts or updates by creating a note, similar to a tweet.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong>: Interact with others by replying to or liking their notes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="#step-5-customize-your-experience" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="step-5-customize-your-experience"></a>Step 5: Customize Your Experience</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Relays Carefully</strong>: Some relays may specialize in certain topics or enforce content moderation policies. Tailor your relay list based on your interests and values.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Your Keys</strong>: Use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets or encrypted cloud storage to protect your private key.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Clients</strong>: Try multiple clients to find the one that suits your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>After generating a keypair on a nostr app (I started with primal) I copied my
public key to <code>/.well-known/nostr.json</code> and put that at the root of my site at
<code>https://pype.dev</code>.</p>
<p>The file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">
{
  “names”: {
    “nic”: “npub1q3fsec2vcv99v80ga72dlv90qwkqmuxqcr6mdyumcmpkgudlhrespyurfj”
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So now I can use <code>nic@pype.dev</code> as on nostr because the client will verify the
pubkey associated with my profile with my domain!</p>

<p>I was debugging some ArgoCD stuff earlier today and I love using k9s to explore
my k8s resources.</p>
<p>The TLDR is that I put some bad env vars in the <code>global</code> values for my ArgoCD
pods, this caused the webUI to hang. An easy way to push things through is to
open k9s, view the Deployments, and edit the env vars there so the pods can be
in the right state to restart and pickup the changes (you've obviously fixed
the values file already right?)</p>
<p>Well the Notification Controller was the pod hanging, and I couldn't find it in
the Deployments view! This blew my mind... until I realized that it was a
Stateful Set.</p>
<p>So, this is not a comparison of the 2 - this is just a note to say that all I
had to do was find the StatefulSets in k9s and do the same workflow for editing
what I needed to edit to get the pods into workable state while working on the
values file...</p>

<p>docker contexts are great, would recommend putting them in your prompt though (via starship or something else)... here's why</p>
<p>I like to manage my containers remotely - I have a nice development setup on my desktop and I try to keep my server as bare-bones as possible. For a while I've been using ansible which makes it easy to manage configuration etc on other machines. But I recently learned about docker contexts and I'm planning to scale down my homelab management to just docker-compose stacks rather than a bunch of super complicated ansible playbooks</p>
<p>So, setting up a context is easy - it's basically an ssh connection to another machine!</p>
<p><code>docker context create koober --docker &quot;host=ssh://nic@koober&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>koober</code> is one of my dev machines and my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> is setup such that I can <code>ssh nic@koober</code>, this makes the context work really seamlessly.</p>
<p>So there's the <code>default</code> context (the machine you're on) and now I have <code>koober</code></p>
<p>To use it you run <code>docker context use koober</code></p>
<p>And then to check we can <code>ls</code> the contexts</p>
<pre><code>docker context ls
NAME       DESCRIPTION                               DOCKER ENDPOINT               ERROR
default    Current DOCKER_HOST based configuration   unix:///var/run/docker.sock   
koober *                                             ssh://nic@koober
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice the * - that indicates that's our current context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#trouble" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="trouble"></a>Trouble</h2>
<p>Now here's where things get hairy... you've gotta be super-aware of what context you're using. I have an indicator in my starship prompt that shows the current context, but since I'm new to using them I kind of didn't notice it until I ran into this issue...</p>
<p>I'm working on a python application in docker but was not able to execute the entrypoint even though I KNEW the file was there... let's take a look</p>
<h3><a href="#example" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="example"></a>Example</h3>
<p>Here's a minimal hello world applycation in docker to illustrate the issue</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># main.py
print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile"># Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app

<h2><a href="#what-happened" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="what-happened"></a>What happened...</h2>
<p>What happened turns out to be pretty simple once we realize I'm using contexts...</p>
<p><code>koboer</code> is a remote context, the <code>docker run</code> and <code>docker compose up</code> commands are interacting with the docker socket on that machine.</p>
<p>So if I compose up the stack notice that there's a volume bind mount in there - well those do <em>not</em> work with contexts (or at least I'm not aware of hose to make it work) and so the <code>/app</code> directory was getting blown away essentially with an empty overlay...</p>
<p>But when running with just <code>docker run</code> with no volume mount, the code was copied in during the build and is right where we expect it...</p>

<p>I'm building a few FastAPI apps to throw in docker and run on my homelab... I wanted to add healthchecks and here's a simple way to do it</p>
<p>Make sure to install <code>curl</code> in the dockerfile (near the top for effeciency)</p>
<pre><code># Install curl with minimal dependencies
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get clean &amp;&amp; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

</code></pre>
<p>Then I recommend making compose files even for single image deployments</p>
<pre><code>services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: .
        target: /app
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/app
      - DOCKER_ENV=true
      - UV_VIRTUALENV=/opt/app-env
    user: &quot;1000:1000&quot;
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [&quot;CMD&quot;, &quot;curl&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:8000/health&quot;]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

</code></pre>
<p>Then finally you'll need a <code>/health</code> endpoint</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
@app.get(&quot;/health&quot;, response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def health_check():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A health check endpoint that returns a status message.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Service is healthy&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;

<p>I use LSIO Jelyfin container for the easy addon they provide for AMD GPUs but I couldn't get trickplay to work with HWE...</p>
<p>There was almost NOTHING on the internet about the error, and all the threads were about BSD systems...</p>
<p>Thankfully someone posted <a href="https://forum.jellyfin.org/t-jellyfin-amd-docker">on the formum here</a> but the only answer was to literally upgrade stuff in the container...</p>
<p>Someday maybe I'll build off of LSIO to add this, but until then I shell'd in and homelab'd the hell out of it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS IS INSIDE THE CONTAINER - I use Portianer to make it easy</p>

<p>I am moving a hefty amount of data to a new ZFS pool due to some corruption and I want to avoid using <code>zfs send/recv</code> for this just to make sure I don't propagate any corrupted data to my new pool.</p>
<p>I've used <code>rsync</code> for simple things before but I needed this to be a little smarter and I wanted to see simple progress without flooding my terminal with a billion filenames.</p>
<h2><a href="#tldr" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="tldr"></a>TLDR</h2>
<p>TLDR:
<code>rsync -aHAX --chmod=Da+s --info=progress2 --inplace --exclude='encrypted/docker/frigate-media' /tank/ /harbor/</code></p>
<h2><a href="#explanation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="explanation"></a>Explanation</h2>
<p>-aHAX: Preserves attributes (archive mode, hard links, ACLs, extended attributes).
--chmod=Da+s: Ensures the setgid bit is applied to directories.
--info=progress2: Provides detailed progress information, including overall data transfer stats.
--inplace: Writes directly to the destination file, avoiding temporary files (useful for large files).
--exclude='encrypted/docker/frigate-media': Excludes the specified path (relative to the /tank root).
/tank/ /harbor/: Ensures the contents of /tank are copied directly into /harbor.</p>

<h2><a href="#htop" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="htop"></a>Htop</h2>
<p>I recently have been having significant home server issues, and that's not the point of this - today I learned what <code>D</code> state is when looking at htop.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/d-htop.png" alt="htop-d" title="htop with D state" />
<p>Apparently this means &quot;uninterruptable sleep&quot; and it's a dev's nightmare...</p>
<h3><a href="#context" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="context"></a>Context</h3>
<p>The issue I was having was that some <code>zfs rollback</code> commands were hung - for hours... I wasn't sure what was going on, rollbacks should be instant but I figured it was just an artifact of these issues.</p>
<p>Turns out I still don't know what locked the disks up but I learned why <code>&lt;C&gt;-c</code> did <u>nothing</u>...
the more you know</p>

<p>the Logos web app is DISGUSTINGY bright/white - enough to actually ruin your morning...</p>
<p>Thankfully there's an extension called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">stylus</a> and some kind folks in the Logos community created a nice dark theme <a href="https://userstyles.world/style/18547/logos-web-app-dark-mode">here</a>. You simply install the extension, then go to the userstyles link &lt;-- and click <code>install</code>. It only changes themes for the sites configured - in this case <a href="app-logos-com.html">app.logos.com</a></p>

<p>I rebooted by server and DNS broke randomly. I have no idea if it was from a kernel update or what but that's the issue with Ubuntu I guess...</p>
<p>After much toil and none of the other options working for me (sorry to not have those documented here) this is what got me the vic from this <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1406827/how-to-set-dns-on-ubuntu-22-04-when-you-have-no-netplan-config">SO Post</a></p>
<p>sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/
sudo $EDITOR /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_servers.conf</p>
<p>Most folks probably are good with google (8.8.8.8) and cloudflare (1.1.1.1)</p>
<pre><code>[Resolve]
DNS=8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1
</code></pre>
<p>But I decided to use tailscale</p>
<pre><code>[Resolve]
DNS=100.100.100.100
</code></pre>
<p>Then restart systemd-resolved</p>
<p>sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved</p>
