Truly, I say to you, there will\nnot be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”  \n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:1–2). (2016). Crossway Bibles.\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Matthew 24:37–39 (ESV): 37 For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming\nof the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating\nand drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered\nthe ark, 39 and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away,\nso will be the coming of the Son of Man. \n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (Mt 24:37–39). (2016). Crossway Bibles.\n</code></pre>\n<p>At one point in Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple in\nJerusalem, he brings up the Son of Man and Noah...</p>\n<p>Jesus says that the &quot;coming of the Son of Man&quot; will be like when Noah built the\nark, and no one understood until the flood (κατακλυσμός | kataklysmos) came and\ntook them away.</p>\n<p>In Jesus' mind the flood narrative gives him imagery and vocabulary to talk\nabout when God allows foreign powers to come and bring judgement... This isn't\nan interpretation of the flood narrative, but it clues us into the idea that\nthe Hebrew bible is full of imagery, like a quilt, that follows a (or several)\npattern(s).</p>\n<pre><code>Jesus understood the flood story as a pattern - a theological category to talk\nabout God overthrowing the corrupt power systems of our world - Tim Mackie\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think sometimes we look at the flood and think God is so bad for taking out\nall of humanity, but we miss the point... God is RESTORING humanity by\nremoving corruption... that's eventually the story we're invited into via\nfaith in Jesus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#types\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"types\"></a>Types</h2>\n<p>A <code>type</code> is a category of prophecy, and an <code>antitype</code> is the revelation of the type.</p>\n<p>Essentially - a <code>type</code> is a pattern, and the <code>antytype</code> is the revelation of\nthe meaning of the pattern - and without understanding the preceding types (in\nthis case, the flood) then the antitype cannot be understood (in this case\nbaptism)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a trivial example of how a type, or a pattern, can be noticed and even build\nanticipation is to think 2, 4, 6, 8... what comes next? 10, and we all know\nthat immediately. Types in general, and types in the Bible are no different,\nalbeit not so simple...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"#flood-and-baptism\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"flood-and-baptism\"></a>Flood and Baptism</h2>\n<p>Brace yourself...</p>\n<pre><code>1 Peter 3:18–22 (ESV): 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous\nfor the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the\nflesh but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which he went and proclaimed to the\nspirits in prison, 20 because they formerly did not obey, when God’s patience\nwaited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few,\nthat is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which\ncorresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but\nas an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus\nChrist, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with\nangels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.  \n\nThe Holy Bible: English Standard Version (1 Pe 3:18–22). (2016). Crossway\nBibles.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice verse 21 - &quot;Baptism, which <u>corresponds</u> to this&quot;</p>\n<p>Corresponds is the word ἀντίτυπος (antitupos) in Greek, which means &quot;anti-type&quot;\nThis means clearly that the <code>type</code>, or <em>a</em> type, for baptism, is the flood\nnarrative... or that baptism is the antitype for the flood</p>\n<p>What does this mean for baptism?</p>\n<pre><code>21 Baptism, which\ncorresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but\nas an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus\nChrist, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with\nangels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him\n</code></pre>\n<p>Through baptism, we experience with Jesus, resurrection and rule of the angels,\nauthorities, and power of the world...</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#take-away\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"take-away\"></a>Take Away</h2>\n<p>For the disciples listening... are they arguing about when the flood happened?\nor if it was a global or local flood?</p>\n<p>No... they are listening to Jesus unpack patterns in the Bible and they hear\nhim invite them, through a story they know very well, into rule and reign with\nhim</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",

In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date you\nbut would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning\nthat was never intended to be present.</p>\n<p>The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that\nmight've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else\nsomeone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they\nare telling with their quilt.</p>\n<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be\n&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) <u>repurposed</u> it for that very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#creation-as-a-quilt\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"creation-as-a-quilt\"></a>Creation as a Quilt</h2>\n<p>The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their\ntime and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate the story of the <em>actual</em> God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>\n<p>For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;, but at the very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#calm-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\" id=\"calm-down\"></a>Calm Down</h2>\n<p>A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they\nknow.</p>\n<p>It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>\n<p>That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and\nnarratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his\nlove for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which starts in the Garden and is how Revelation ends</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
